This list is intended to facilitate focus, share sentiments, and explore ideas.

First and formost, this is a list of concepts about which I am curious. This implies a certain amount of rollover. That said, the list of concepts and projects below have been the center of my attention for a nontrivial period of time and I intend to continue working on aspects of the below.

* reconfigurable hardware
 * function determined predominantly by expressed ideas
  * XMOS
  * the cee
  * programmable logic / FPGAs
  * logicwhacker
  * RALA / rala.cba.mit.edu

* variable abstraction environments
 * enables the curious and ambitious to learn and build new things by facilitating the manipulation of information at various levels on the [ladder of abstraction](worrydream.com/#!/LadderOfAbstraction) such as...
  * logicwhacker
  * toolpath-aware parameteric CAD software
  * abstore
  * zoomable user interfaces for content exploration - annotated shakespeare, noteslate

* bit/atom bridges
 * enabling the interplay of digital logic / computational systems and physical materials 
  * the cee
  * MEMS sensors
  * microfluidics
  * most everything coming out of cba.mit.edu
  * additive manufacturing techniques
  * synthetic biology


* computational architectures, especially novel / [non-neumann](nonneumann.tumblr.com)
 * GreenArrays
 * OpenRISC
 * AMD's Fusion / Heterogeneous System Architecture
