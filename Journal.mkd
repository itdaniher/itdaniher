Hey everybody,

Just a quick note to let you all know that we SO APPRECIATE the kind words, thoughts, emails, prayers and so forth.
Ian has been home resting all day and has done a great job keeping his arm elevated.

He has a Shriner's clinic appointment on Monday which will be where he will likely be placed in his cast...for six or seven weeks.
As we know more, I will update the journal on Monday evening.
In the meantime, Happy New Year to you all.

May your 2010 exceed even your wildest expectations!

Wednesday AM update!

Ian has been released from Shriners and is now home. &nbsp;Now he can torment Nanci instead of the nurses, but at least he will not have an IV and he can now eat when he wants.

The key short term will be keeping him medicated so as to not let the pain get hold of him once the block wears off.



#### <time> Tuesday, December 29, 2009 5:09 PM </time>

Hi all, just a quick update.
Ian awoke about 20 minutes ago and about 5 minutes before the Doc stopped in for the evening check.
The thumb has good color and as of right now, Ian is not in too much pain.
He is not a big fan of morphine so he may do his best to not use the pain pump.
His IV will come out tomorrow AM as he has two doses of antibiotics due between now and then.

Ian will likely be in and out of sleep between now and when he goes home tomorrow.

Thank you all for your kind words of support and encouragement.

11:25 am
Just Finished Meeting with Ian's Doc
While the surgery was supposed to be an hour and a half, things went a little long.
The extra two hours happened because once Ian's hand was opened up, additional damage to Ian's "original" thumb bone was discovered that probably was fallout from the original electrical shock.
So, about a centimeter of mushy bone had to be removed before enough good bone could be found to be able to attach the plate to join the toe bone to the the thumb bone.
(Insert catchy tune here...) 
For all you medigeeks out there, Ian's Metacarpal and Metatarsal are now joined with a titanium plate and self tapping 1.5 mm micro screws.
Some healthy spongy bone stuff (not technical term, but I forgot what exactly it was called) was taken from his wrist bone and put in the middle of the two bones to promote growth and healing and bonding.
I asked if they could put in some Gorilla Glue or something like that to stick these two things together, but that option did not seem to be a very good one.
It also means that I should stick to financial planning and stay away from bone surgery.

Ian will be here at Shriner's today and tonight.
Due to the H1N1 bug, visitors are not allowed, not even siblings.
Too many kids with weakened immune systems here fighting for their lives, which we completely understand.
Ian will likely go home tomorrow AM and will be in a dressing and splint for a week.
Then, assuming the small incision is healing well, he will be put in a cast for six weeks.
If Ian promises to behave, he gets to go back to Boston until he returns around Valentines Day to have the cast taken off and we get to see how things turned out.  
*  
Ediorial comment from Ian's dad directed at all of Ian's Olin buds.
Make sure that my son does not do anything stupid like go sledding, or get in a snowball fight, or try unicycling, OK?
He has a tendancy to get caught up in the moment.
I ask all of you to be the "boss of him" and keep him from doing anything like swinging on the tree rope in Parcel Three or other stuff that could cause this surgery to be an epic fail.
Now back to our regularly scheduled programming...

During this surgery, nothing has been done cosmetically to his thumb and the existing scarring or extra tissue.
This is planned for later surgeries.
The one and only goal here is to fuse the toe bone to the thumb bone.
This is absolutely vital if Ian is to be able to pinch and hold things between his thumb and his fingers.

In case of an emergency, our doc here knows a doc friend in Boston who can be a standby in case something unexpected happens.
Nanci has also located a hand therapist there who has had experience with toe to thumb transplants.
Of course, all of this is pretty meaningless if we can't get the bone to fuse.

So, if you happen to have blank space on your prayer list, please add in a little request specifically that the bone cells in Ian's thumb bone take a real strong liking to the bone cells in Ian's neothumb AKA toe bone and that they decide to bond, like permanently.
Pray that the cells grow together like the tree roots do in Avatar.

Hello All, and good Morning!
Ian went back to surgery this AM about 7:20.
I went up to the cafeteria to grab a bite to eat for breakfast.
Nanci returned home to be with the crew.

Ian did not go to bed until about 3 AM or so, after the nurse chided him a bit.
She told me that she could see that he was nervous and since he was not causing any trouble, she let him just be.

It would be fair to say that I think that we are all coming into this with pretty low expectations.
Our hopes for his hand to be "normal" were pretty much dashed a surgery or two ago, when the bones did not want to cooperate.
I can't say for sure what Nanci and Ian think, but it is my wish that his hand be given a good level of functionality, whatever that means.
I try not to think about it too much as it just makes me very sad inside.
I see all that Ian is able to do with his mind and his hand and a half and I wonder what else he could be doing if only...and that is when I have to stop myself.

My son is my son.
He is who he is and the accident almost three years ago did not change that much about him.
We have so much to be grateful for, things being better than they could have been, that I really need to focus on what is going right and not what is not the way that I want it.

I am praying for peace of mind and for skilled surgeon's hands, and for his body to knit together what will give him a thumb that works.

Good Evening.
Checked in.
Cheesesteak sandwich for dinner.
Waiting on more admission paperwork.
Lots and Lots and Lots of memories.
Ian is, of course, nervous.
Quite understandible.

Likely to be in the hospital just for a day or two after surgery.


Surgery is scheduled for about 7 AM tomorrow.

Ironically, Ian is in the room that is also set up for sleep studies.
I have offered to demonstrate to Ian what it feels like to be hooked up for a sleep study.
He passed.

Night all.

Hi All,
Long time no update.
Just a quick note to give a status update.
And you thought that Ian was done.
Wrong.
Unfortunately.

Ian enters Shriners tonight for another surgery tomorrow.
The goal of this procedure is to attach the two bones that did not join together after the last surgery.
Metal, plates, and screws will be involved.
So will a cast.
For four to six weeks.
And more therapy.
Just what a college freshman needs to compete with his already (over)full life at Franklin Olin College of Engineering.

I will post some updates over the next few days.
And, Merry Christmas everyone!

Done and Still Not Done

Graduation turned out to be something Ian reluctantly enjoyed.
It added the sense of finality he needed, and was a great way to mark the moment.
His grandparents from Florida and the Canton area all attended, which was a great treat.

Our most recent visit to Shriners showed an inconclusive X-ray, with clinical signs pointing that his thumb may be healing.
It is definitely in better alignment than the last visit.
So, we continue onward unsure of the outcome, with tentative hope.

Ian, as usual, has found a life of purpose through lab work and friends.
His old friend, Alex, is home from college.
He keeps in touch with friends at home, and new friends from the Olin class of 2013. 
Anticipation of college has him thinking about
possibilities and potential.
It's great to be almost 18! 


#### <time> Thursday, May 28, 2009 7:37 AM </time>

Done.

And Not Done.
Ian is "officially" done with high school.
Tonight they have a graduation service in the school chapel, and on Sunday there is the official graduation ceremony.
He is into it about as much as he is into cleaning his room, but we keep telling him that it is NOT for him.
Both sets of Grandparents are in town as is his "Aunt Lois" (Grandma Ruth's sister).
We will be having a big brunch on Sunday before the graduation ceremony.

The not done part is that the thumb bones are very slow to heal, if they are even growing to together at all.
It is just so discouraging.
Ian has been beyond faithful in wearing his splint.
I just wish that we could have the confidence that a full recovery is in site, like we can see the end of high school and the beginning of college.

Jeff 


#### <time> Friday, May 15, 2009 10:26 AM </time>

The countdown continues...

Today is the last day of official full school days for Ian.
Senior chapel will mark the end of full-time attendance for all seniors.
Because of his crazy schedule, Ian still has one class to attend for the next two weeks, and some projects to finish for other junior level classes.
We celebrate the end of his hard work and efforts. 


#### <time> Sunday, May 10, 2009 7:54 AM </time>

*Play it Again, Sam...*

Sorry I didn't write sooner.
I couldn't.
Just couldn't commit it to print.

Well, we are playing a familiar tune, but it is a pretty sad song.
Last visit was Friday, May 1.
Ian got an x-ray and exam, which revealed that his thumb is not healing.
He has, in essence, a broken thumb.
The doc cut it on 3/13 with a bone saw to straighten it, pinned it.
The efforts to rejoin it have so far fallen short.
His thumb is in a splint for 6 more weeks in hopes that a miracle will happen, and it will join into a strong working thumb.

At the moment, the doc is planning to not operate to fix it.
We are in limbo.
Ian's thumb is swimming in limbo.
The good news is that he's not in too much pain, and the rest of his life is good; if not exciting.
Our next appointment is June 5.

And we thought we were going to be done with the roller coaster ride.

Ian is doing an amazing job learning everything he missed in his last absence, and completing missed assignments.
He continues to just "keep on" with the most positive outlook possible.
What else can he do?

THANK YOU

all for your prayers. 

- Nanci

There comes a time in every post-surgery recovery where Ian and I just get "overdone" with all things medical and surgery related.
After Ian's pins came out (11 days ago) we just lost all interest in coping with everything that being a patient/caregiver duo entails.
Meh.
We were told that the thumb had not grown enough bone to have any strength, and he needed to protect and baby it and wear a protective "globe" splint to keep it from being bumped.
Has anyone seen the busy halls of a high school changing classes?
What a tall order!
Ian missed a few more days of school until we found a splint that worked.
So, we immersed ourselves in fun things.
I played "Design on a Dime" and re-did Megan's room (including installation of new flooring, with Sean's help).
Ian busied himself with experiments for fun.

I think, on balance, it was a good thing to take a break.


Yesterday, Ian got a cast.
He is probably the first 17 year old on the planet to think that's a wonderful thing.
It is smaller, lighter, and less noticeable than any of his splints.
It gives rigid, accurate protection that doesn't need to be re-molded every day and a half.
Yay!

He will wear the cast for two weeks...right through prom.

Thank you all for your prayers.
God encourages us through the terrific people in our lives.
Life goes on, and Life Is Good.

Back on the Roller Coaster

We had a great weekend.
Ian's hand was doing well, and he got to relax and have fun.
He finished the last of the oral antibiotics, so his tummy felt better too.

Fast forward to this morning, when his thumb - around the pins - was looking a little extra red and angry like before.
This is not any kind of surprise, but it is not ideal.
Those pins may need to be removed before his appointment on Friday.
As soon as the pins come out, we have to be extra careful with the bone that is trying mightily to knit itself together.
It's like removing a cast early.

In spite of all this, Ian went to school today.
His hand is snugly wrapped and splinted.
It will do him good to get back in the normal swing of things.

Thanks for continuing to walk this journey with us!


#### <time> Thursday, April 2, 2009 5:05 PM </time>

We really must write a manual...

Whatever technicolor craziness went on in Ian's hand earlier this week, it was FINE today.
Even more of the inflamation has gone away.
We are content with the blessing of being able to move forward, tentatively, and just live life.

Thank you so much for all your prayers, guestbook memos, emails, Tweets, phone calls, and Facebook postings.
It is excellent to have so many friends who care.
Really.
You make life do-able, even when it's crazy.

In case you ever need to know...

It is normal that when a pin (or two) stick out of one's skin, that seepage is normal. So, our visit today confirmed that Ian's infection IS getting better, that the neon yellow color on the bandages was probably "only" plasma, and that such ooze is to be expected. Hmmm. Maybe Shriners ran short on their supply of "what to expect when your kid's thumb has two pins sticking out of it" manual. :)

Both Nanci and I regret any undue concern that we may have caused you with our incessant postings this last week or so. Ian did have an infection. It is getting better, even if it does not look normal (to us), but then again, we have not had much experience with this concept. I mean, books are written about what to expect when you are expecting, and how to raise kids, but I must have skipped the chapter about what "normal" ooze should look like.

Echoing Nanci's words of earlier today, it is hard to be scared and grateful at the same time, but we are trying. Perhaps it is because we have been through a bunch over the last few years and the thought of possibly losing all that has been worked so long and hard to rebuild scares me...just a bit.

Here is hoping to NO "urgent prayers needed" postings for at least the next week or so. At least until a week from Friday, when the pins get pulled out. 

Thanks, and good night!

*Wednesday Update: Another unscheduled appointment*

Ian woke at 11 am to a bunch of yellow goo in the ointment. Never a good sign. Best case, it could just be a bunch of tissue breaking down. Worst case....um, we won't go there.

We got to the hospital at 2:30 to have it looked at and make a plan.


#### <time> Wednesday, April 1, 2009 6:37 AM </time>

Roller Coaster Ride

We were happy with the progress of Ian's thumb by Monday, and Ian got caught up on a lot of work. The doc was happy and made an appointment for two weeks out. The pins are to be removed then. This is the 4th week...the earliest he would want them removed IF we can stay infection-free.

Tuesday started uneventfully. Ian was planning to go back to school again this week. By end of the day Tuesday, Ian was nautious from the medication and his thumb was red and ouchy again.

We are just keeping on. More pearlized miracle ointment, more pills. More prayers.

He's not awake yet this morning. I let him sleep in hopes that his tummy feels better.

Will update later today when I see what shade of trouble we have now.


#### <time> Monday, March 30, 2009 8:41 AM </time>

Hello All...this is an update from Sunday

Ian's hand IS looking somewhat better today, and the primary sore around his pins has not gotten any bigger. He has been diligent about taking his pills. Some friends came over last night to keep him company. It did a great job of distracting him. They all cooked dinner and had a blast with things like physics and calc...and some chemistry for fun. Sean and Megan have been great helpers. Ian is doing OK.

We are not out of the woods, but we are breathing a bit easier now that his thumb is not looking worse every time we take down the dressing. Who knew there were so many different ways the human body can process things? Glad we're a family who likes to examine strange things. The past two years have been like a twisted version of a science project.

Ian and Nanci are at Shriners right now for a follow up visit.

JD


#### <time> Friday, March 27, 2009 9:23 PM </time>

Cellulitis

*Ian's case is about the size of a dime around where the pins stick out. Threatens limb, but not life at this point.*

Never good news, but we hope we caught it early enough. *No red streaks (blood poisoning) leading down the arm, so it's not near systemic.* He's on an oral antibiotic and topical silver/sulfa treatment. We have an appointment Monday morning for a re-check, and orders to call over the weekend if there is anything but improvement. *Ian has had many complications in his 18 surgeries...failed portions of graft, necrotic tissue, and misaligned bone structure. In order to round out our experiences, we had to try infection too....right?*

The site around the pins, where Ian's thumb has problems, sometimes gets like this when the body doesn't adjust well to the presence of pins, or pressure on the thumb in the wrong place...add some stray bacteria, and here we are. We got a new splint.. We got medication. *On the woulda, coulda, shoulda questions. We were good about care, but can always have been better.*

*Ian is now at home. He is doing chemistry, so he's not dwelling on the risk factors with his thumb. Distraction is very good.*

And we're praying.

A little help, please.

From a text that I got from Ian just a minute ago...

"Send some prayers my way, my hand isn't looking very good...:("

The area around his pins is inflamed, the graft on his palm is having contractures (in a different place than last time at least) and his hand still remains swollen.

Nanci takes Ian to Shriners today at 11:30; they are quite short staffed as many are at a national burn convention.

Any and all prayers are appreciated.

Gruesomely Beautiful!

This is an oxymoron if I have ever heard one, but they are the only two words that I could put together to describe what we saw when Ian's had was unwrapped yesterday. Surgery was a week ago, and since that time, Ian had his hand in a cousin to the "slug" that he had two years ago when he had a wet bandage.

The photos I have added to the picture section of this site are not ones that you should look at right before dinner. But, I wanted to jump for joy when I took them. You see, Ian's largest problem has been the scaring on his palm. It has been his nemesis. 

When the bandages were being unwrapped, both Nanci and I were holding our collective breaths. Would his third skin graft take? Would it be the good color, or the dusky grey color of death, indicating that this one too would have failed.

What we saw, well, it isn't pretty. But it is. The skin is a healthy color. As healthy as skin that was removed from his groin area and transplanted to his palm could be. And his thumb...well, it, for the first time in two years, stopped looking like a toe and has started looking like a thumb. Sort of. If you squint.

Ian will be off school for at least a week. The wounds are still fresh and schools are germy places. Not something that we want to chance. Heck, I would put him in a plastic bubble if it meant that we would have success. 

We have come so far. More surgeries than I can count. Seventeen? Eigheen? Some day I will have to have a firm count done so I don't exaggerate. But, the end is near. No surgeries for a while, maybe even a year. There will be cosmetic work to be done, but so far, function looks like it will be there.

Thanks Doc. Thanks Shriners. Thanks to all of you for your prayers. And support. Thanks.

Jeff


#### <time> Tuesday, March 17, 2009 8:23 AM </time>

Back in the saddle...

Ian didn't spend much time in do-nothing recovery mode. Yesterday, he took time to [begin] to clean his basement lab.

He has, however, finally relented and takes pain medication at night so that he can function in the late afternoon and sleep at night.

Thanks to all who have provided very yummy food. Ian has been eating well, and enjoying a change from Mom's regular menus.

The suture line in his side (not his thigh, as we originally thought) has been healing nicely, and doesn't affect his mobility much. The hand is still wrapped up in its post-surgery dressing. The hard part begins Friday when it is opened and cleaned for the first time...then we kick into dressing change and rehab mode. Never the fun part, but at least in this round we can envision the future. When Ian left the hospital in April of 2007, after partial healing, he was confronted with a really heavy door -- at least that is how it seemed to his "new" left hand. Even on into summer, it seemed impossible that he would EVER be able to open that door with his damaged hand. Last week, it gave him a good sense of satisfaction to observe that it was a non-issue two years later...OF COURSE he can do that!

So, we know that we only need to look forward a year, and he will be fine.

The long view is really important to lots of things...like financial markets.

Wishing everyone an optimistic day! 


#### <time> Saturday, March 14, 2009 10:26 AM </time>

Home and happy...

Ian is reading the latest issue of Technology Review on the couch. (Thanks, Grandpa Frank!)

All concerned with Ian's care have suggested pain medication, but Ian prefers a clear head. So, he's just hanging in and trying to be the tough guy. Anyone who wants to give him a call on his cell phone or our home phone this morning is welcome to. It would be a great distraction. Of course, I'm sure he'll be online later today.

Megan continues to swim and Jeff is timing this morning. We hope her meet goes well.

Sean is just hanging out in his room, where he will likely remain for the rest of the day. We hope his fever finally goes away.

Thanks to all for your prayers and good wishes. Please keep praying for Ian's palm to heal smoothly and open, and his digits to return to maximum dexterity. We know we will have much physical therapy ahead in coming months. His surgery was scheduled for this time of year so that his therapy can be done before going off to college.

Til later... 


#### <time> Saturday, March 14, 2009 8:18 AM </time>

Freedom!

[Nanci here] Ian will be picked up at the hospital at 9:30 am. He will be headed home for a weekend of rest.

Warning to all potential visitors...Ian is coming home to a brother (and maybe mom) with a virus that includes cough and fever. Sean has been home all week with this bug. We kept thinking he was better, and then he would take a turn for the worse. It is going around school for ALL the kids I know in the area. So, we will keep you posted about the situation here.

Ian slept most of the day yesterday. Really. The pre-op medication they gave to "relax" him seemed to have put him out for the duration. Our home-care for the next week will be pretty simple. Suture line cleaning where they took the graft, and we have to keep the pin-site clean (his thumb pins stick out about 2cm). Other than that, the hand stays wrapped exactly as doc left it...until Ian's Friday clinic appointment.

Megan and Jeff are away at the regional YMCA swim championships. Ian's surgery was originally scheduled for Monday 3/16, so this seemed like a reasonable idea at the time. Go, Megan! Swim fast!

Ian won't be running a marathon anytime soon, but hopefully he will bounce back quickly.


#### <time> Friday, March 13, 2009 11:05 AM </time>

Surgery is Done 

warning: graphic details to follow

Just finished meeting with Doc. The surgery went well. First, a small piece of bone was removed just past where the "new thumb" (toe) was previously connected. This shortening of the length of the bone within the new thumb takes the pressure off both blood vessels and the surrounding tissue. Second, the ends of both parts of the bone were smoothed and then connected together. Ian will have two pins in his thumb for about four to six weeks that are designed to keep the bone straight and in place while it heals. The pins will stick out of his skin. After the bone has healed, the pins will be removed.

A 4 by 7 cm graft was taken from Ian's other thigh and was used to replace the scared surface of his palm. This fresh graft should result in a much more attractive looking palm. Where the tissue was taken from his thigh it was closed with stitches to help it heal better. Now Ian will have partially matching scars on each leg.

Some of the "extra" tissue from the base of the thumb has been removed, but Ian will still have additional material there. Rather than try to do too much at one time, Doc was cautious.

His old skin graft sight on his right thigh was treated with a laser. This was designed to remove the redness from the healing tissue and give the new skin much more of a normal look.

The end of Ian's thumb may have more flexibility than he did before. Ian had regained some movement in the new thumb over the last few months, but as the tissue and tendons were stretched tight, the movement was limited. Doc is hopeful that he will have nearly complete opposition (pinching ability) with his fingers on his left hand and the thumb in its new position.

Ian will be in Shriners overnight, and will then head home on Saturday afternoon. His hand will remain wrapped and packed for one week to keep it in the proper healing position. Also, his thumb, rather than being at nearly a right angle up from his palm, will now be laid flat. To imagine what this looks like, put your left hand palm up flat on a table. If you point your thumb towards the ceiling, this is how his hand was. If you rest the back of your thumb on the table, this is how his hand will be able to rest, assuming all heals well.

Ian will have a splint for 24 hours a day for the first period of time, followed by one just at night. More therapy (what else is new?) will be in his future.

What we don't know at this time is whether this will be his last surgery or not. The possibility will exist for minor future cosmetic surgery depending on how things heal. 

Nanci and I ask for the following prayers:

* In gratitude for the people of Shriners: The donors, the doctors and nurses, and all of the staff.
* For healing for Ian's hand.
* For the other kids here; for their healing both in body and in mind. This is especially important for the young man who that has been here for the last month that unfortunately came into contact with a high power line while helping at home. He has lost an arm.

Through all of this, we have been blessed beyond belief. Each one of you taking an interest in a young man who, while creative, was not as cautious as he should have been. It is easy to judge how stupid this was, and yet, I know that Ian and us have never felt judged. Instead, we have felt loved beyond belief.

Our journey is not done. There are still challenges in Ian's future, as well as opportunities. For this, Nanci and I are simply overwhelmed with thankfulness. Driving to Shriners early this AM reminded me of the high speed trip down the road to the hospital just over two years ago. This time, it is different, thank God.

Jeff

Ian went back at 7:55

Ian was sound asleep, so no worries for the kid whose mantra is "nitrous before needles"... He seems to handle everything in stride except for the IV. Oh, and a catheter, but that should not be an issue for today.

Dr. Y told Nanci and I that the surgery will be about an hour and a half. Ian will likely be getting some cool internal metalic parts, like a pin, or a wire loop, or both. They may be permanent or they may be temporary. We shall have to see what we shall see.

More after he is out.

Good Morning!

It was pretty early this AM on the way to Shriners. Saw both a skunk and a racoon crossing the road. Was able to avoid both successfully.

Ian's surgery will be the second one today, likley about 8. In addition to having the work done on his hand, he will also get a laser treatment on his graft site. I bet that he would like to be awake to watch this procedure. 

Ian's comment this morning was that why did he need to be awoken in order to get medicines to be put to sleep? Typical Ian. Witty in the face of nervousness.

Shriners feels, just the same as it has over the last two years. A comfortable place, but not one that a person would voluntarily spend extra time at for a vacation.

I will give another update after his surgery this morning.

Until then,

Jeff

Perspective

This is what you get when you stop feeling sorry for yourself and your own situation and you realize how your life could be so very much different, maybe in a not good way.

Ian's accident was two years ago. For the most part, he is as recovered as he is likely to be. Sure, the next few surgeries will require visits to the hospital, therapy and medication for the pain. But, in between these short periods of time, everything is pretty much back to normal. He is able to do nearly everything he wants, when he wants, the way he wants. (Except for swearing with the left hand. The short middle finger just does not have the same impact.) Because of the generosity of people that we will likely never meet, Ian's life will be just fine.

With the economy being the way that it is, giving to charity seems to be even more "optional" now. Of course, I can certainly appreciate that money may be tight, especially if one has lost a job, or taken a cut to their income. Consider this a gentle nudge, maybe a different perspective, from someone who has benefited from the kindness of strangers, that maybe, just maybe, we can all continue to be generous to the causes that are important to us. You may never see the direct result of your support, but take it from me, it is appreciated. Life changing even.

The Saga Continues--2 years and counting

Ian's next surgery is scheduled for lucky Friday the 13th of March. This one will, hopefully, restore additional function to his hand as well as touch things up cosmetically. It will involve pins, graphs and splints. The surgery date was selected as Ian will be off school for break and can minimize time off of from school.

Speaking about school, Ian has narrowed his college choices down to a first and a second. In second place is Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio. A few weeks ago, Ian and his parents spent two days there and found the school to be exceptional. The only downside that we can see is that the dorm is about a half mile from where the classrooms are, and Cleveland gets cold in the winter. Duh! This is part of the reason that Jeff and Nanci moved from there back in 1991. In any case, this would be a fantastic experience for Ian.

His first choice is likely a school that you may never have heard about before. It is in Needham, Massachusetts, just outside of Boston. The school was built from scratch about a decade ago, and has had two graduating classes so far. All total, there are just under 300 students. Not just in his class, but in all four classes! The school is the Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering.

Ian visited two weeks ago as a candidate on one of the two candidates weekend. The school is so small that they invite prospective students to campus to interview them (both by faculty and by other students) to see if they are a "good fit" for the school. A couple of factoids about Olin from various college ranking sites. It is the fourth most selective school in the country, after Harvard, Princeton and Yale. It is rated as the second school on the list where students study the most. It has "dorms like palaces" and "great food", but ranks real low on the party quotient. (Not that Mom and Dad mind about that.)

What makes the school so special is that it appears to be designed for kids like Ian. The students have nearly 24 hour access to labs. They learn engineering by doing starting as freshman. Students can take a leave of absence if they want to start a business. Google is their number one employer of graduate students at this time. All of the kids who go there are, well, smart. But more than that, they have passion and are eloquent. Both Jeff and Nanci, who had an awesome experience at Grove City, wish that they could have attended a school like this...not that they would have gotten into a school like this!

Ian will find out if he is invited to be a student on March 23rd. This will give him something to look forward to after surgery.

Now, for a brief message from the sponsor. It seems that every spring, from Mid February to about Mid March, school and extracurriculars go crazy. Not just for Ian, but for all of our kids. Probably yours too, or probably, if you are a student, you are wondering why I am stating the obvious. Well, here it is: Take care of yourself and your loved ones. Two years ago, about this time, is when Ian had his accident. Trying to do too much. Pretty much trying to do everything but sleep. I have seen this cycle repeat itself with my other kids too. So, why am I blogging about this? Well, it is just because I am recommending extra patience with the kids. Cut them some slack. Give them a hug. And make them get some sleep!

Been too long...

Ian is busy with college applications, AP classes, and other senior year in high school stuff.

He has begun looking at colleges, and has a few on his wish list, including Olin in Boston, MIT in Boston, UC Honors, Purdue and Grove City.

As far as his hand goes, we are in a holding pattern until his next surgery, which will be during his spring break. The kind folks at Shriners felt that Ian should be able to have as normal as a senior year as possible, so we have been able to push back the next few surgeries. They will include pinning the toe/thumb and more cosmetic work. His hand will never look normal, but we are still hopeful for more and better function.

As over eighteen months have elapsed since his accident, it is hard to imagine Ian with a normal hand. What has become quite clear is how lucky we are that he is still here. Things could have been quite different.  

 That it wasn't, both Nanci and I say prayers of thanks every day.

A GOOD DAY

I don't think we're ready for any celebrations, but we did get some assurances yesterday from the medical team. They are going to redouble their efforts to schedule around his academic and "senior year" needs, so that he can have things to look forward to.

This was the little bit of hope Ian needed right now!

Also, despite the continued bad healing, the surgeon was very happy with the flexibility in Ian's thumb. Ian has been doing "mini therapy" during almost every class to keep things limber and fight scars. What a battle!

There is a good possibility, assuming everything is healed properly, for Ian's next surgery to be early August....well in advance of his school year.

We'll keep you posted.

ON THE EDGE OF NORMALCY

We have been at this so long; surgeries are getting farther apart and shorter; rehab appointments are fewer but continuing. Many people understandably think we're bringing this chapter of our lives in for a landing.

Today, it's almost as raw as it has ever been.

Ian's last skin graft lost its entire top epidermis layer, and has been shrinking due to more hypertrophic scarring. Bottom line in layman's terms: the whole thing is only a teeny bit better than two months ago, and is still a world away from aesthetically tenable or functional. It's almost right back where it was.

It means we have more surgeries, all six months apart by the doc's estimates.

Translated: kiss a pleasant Senior year goodbye. More time off school. Surgeries stretching into college? More "How can I possibly keep up with that many AP classes?" 

Just plain "How can I keep up?"

Sucks to be Ian right now.

PRAYERS AND PROGRESS

Well, we have another appointment with the doctor today.

Ian spent last week sick with a respiratory virus, and the weekend recuperating.

As a wise person posted on this blog, our faith gives us just enough hope sometimes to keep on going...to take the next step. Between surgery and virus, Ian has again missed over two weeks of school. Next step is to catch up. 

Ditto for his parents and siblings who have also had days down and out with illness. (Probably part of the emotional roller coaster we've all been on as well).

Thanks for your prayers; I'll try to update this evening.

BACK IN THE SADDLE AGAIN

We're back fighting our old friend "scar" It is as discouraging and scary as ever.

The crazy thing in all of this is that intellectually and spiritually, I really believe that focusing on positives is key. I believe that raising my children in a privileged part of a privileged country is no small thing, and we are eternally grateful.

I believe that medical professionals are truly angels; giving and caring for those of us in need. I am grateful.

So, in the midst of all my optimism when do I get to just lie down on the floor and have a temper tantrum about the progress we expect but do not see? When do I get to mourn the extensive time lost to this tragedy, and all the time we are likely to lose in subsequent (likely) surgeries??? It's been a year, right? Move on, right?

I wish we could. That's the problem.

So we keep praying prayers of thanks. And we keep praying to STAY mindful of that thankfulness. 


#### <time> Tuesday, April 8, 2008 8:19 AM </time>

MORE OF THE SAME

Ian went in for a splint change on Friday. The grafts are doing some more of the excessive scarring they have done thus far, and we continue to fight the trend. We keep working on additional movement, but it is slow. Ian is wearing his splint daily. It is small (wrapped around his palm and hand only) and doesn't get in the way too much.

This morning, Ian woke up with a fever of 101. More time off school.

Sometimes just feels like a record (kids: a vinyl audio disc, usually black in color, pre-dating CDs and MP3s) with a serious skip in it. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat.


#### <time> Wednesday, April 2, 2008 9:15 AM </time>

Onward...

One of the big concerns with Ian's surgery was whether the skin graft would "take" or fail. His hand hasn't had the best circulation since the accident, and we've already experienced undue scarring and black ugly spots before. Not something we dwell on; but always there in the back of our minds.

So far, it looks like everything is settling in nicely. Ian has been doing most of his dressing changes, with help from family. It is amazing to see the change one year can make in a young man.

Ian has been back to school, but is still going in late and missing his first two classes. He would probably still be home, except for the advanced afternoon classes. We hope to have him attend full days next week. 

His next checkup and splint change is Friday. Then we'll post some pictures.

Meanwhile, Megan and I are in sunny Florida watching the YMCA national swim championships. It is Megan's first year, and she is enjoying the excitement and her first swim in front of stands filled with 5,000 fans.

Life moves onward next week when we are all home together again.

Thank you all for your continued prayers.

Busy, Busy, Busy...

Sorry for keeping any of your readers in suspense about what we found when Ian's bandages were removed. Nanci and Megan had to get ready for the YMCA swim meet in Florida, and we each thought that the other was going to handle it...well, nevermind.

Ian gladly removed his bandages yesterday, and Dr. Yak seemed to be pleased. There is a good bit of bruising and the grafts are the terrific red, purple and green colors, but this is as to be expected. The great news is that the scar tissue that was keeping Ian's thumb in place is now gone, and it has much more freedom of movement.

Because Ian could not be pinned, the alternative is that we will be making a weekly trip to Shriners for the next six to eight weeks so that Ian can be progressively splinted. By using splints, the hope is to gradually shift the position of the new thumb without pinching the blood supply. 

Ian is quite used to the procedure to change his dressing, which will be at least twice a day until the grafts take. Our good friends, gauze, adaptec and bacitracin are in the house again! Yippee.

All things considered, and while this last procedure is likely NOT the last procedure, Ian's hand is progressing. And, this is a great thing!

Thanks everybody for your prayers, your concern, and your best wishes. Thanks Ronda and Michele for the delicious meals this last week. They really came in handy!

Have a great evening.

NEWS TO COME

We have our post-op "open the bandages" appointment late today. Ian is, understandably, nervous about the whole thing...yet excited to lose the rather ripe gauze assembly.

More later... 


#### <time> Wednesday, March 26, 2008 2:47 PM </time>

IT'S ALL ABOUT BALANCE

It's been a few days since Ian's surgery, and we've got the medications sort of balanced. Ian is able to be up and around most of the day, taking pain meds about every 6 hours or so. Monday, he experienced all the bad things that happen when you wait TOO LONG between doses.

He has slowed down enough that I was able to chase him down and tie him to a chair long enough for a haircut.

Now that we've gotten the pain meds under control, homework can again be a consideration. His only job right now, rehab related, is to keep his side clean and keep his hand bandages dry. We haven't seen anything but his little pink fingertips.

Our next clinic visit is this Friday. They will open the bandages, and tell us where we're going from here.

Smile, wait, and see....

PS. I had technical difficulties today, so if you got a blank journal entry for 1/2 hour, I aplogize. 


#### <time> Sunday, March 23, 2008 9:25 PM </time>

We had a happy, if a bit odd, Easter weekend. Jeff and I went to church. Sick (bad cold) and post-op children all stayed home. The service was one of the most memorable we've ever been to. Wow! God's grace is wonderous!
Ian's side is stiff and in pain, but his spirits are high. Visits from his girlfriend, Cara, and good friend, Alex kept him in good company. His little pink fingertips are peeking out of his bandages. We check them every now and then. Other than that, and a complicated "keep the arm dry" shower process, there's not much to do this week.

Cell phones with free Verizon to Verizon calling are the 21st century version of an intercom. They work quite well for a 4 am medicine run. Ian slept until around 10:30 and was up the rest of the day, until he tanked at 8 pm.

Good night to all....Nanci 


#### <time> Saturday, March 22, 2008 12:45 PM </time>

The back side of all that R& R....

...was that Ian awoke at about 3 am rarin' to go. He fidgeted, watched TV, and we took a walk to the nurse's station at about 5 am, got some snacks and medicine. He mercifully slept until about 9 am.

I couldn't help but rememember lying semi-comatose on the couch at 4 am watching two-year-old Ian enthusiastically playing with blocks. What memories!

The best news today is WE'RE HOME!

Ian is napping now, but quite ready to welcome visitors this evening onward.


#### <time> Friday, March 21, 2008 10:01 PM </time>

*R&R*

One of Ian's biggest challenges over the last couple of years has been finding "down time". He is enthusiastically involved in so many things, that he has very little time to just chill.

Today was an opportunity to make up for lost time. He never did use any of the IV pain meds, but slept the afternoon away anyhow. Around 6pm, he got up and got all the leads taken off and got the IV out. He's taking pills for pain, but only as often as he has to. He still slept most of the day, and is happily snoozing after evening meds.

Adam, thanks for introducing Ian to Orangina...or however you spell it. The European sparkling orange juice drink has really hit the spot. Usually, nothing tastes good to him the day of surgery. Except Cheez-Its!

Well, the doc doesn't think he'll unwrap Ian's hand at all tomorrow. As long as the finger tips are all pretty and pink, we go home for a week of "Wait and See".

Have you ever heard the advice to never ask God to give you patience? He WILL teach you patience if you ask...according to this pop culture advice. Well, I must've said that prayer somewhere along the way. We are all getting LOTS of opportunity to develop patience.

Today's surgery went as well as Ian's anatomy would let it. The rest will be taken care of with therapy and maybe more surgeries.

We will wait and see.

And God will continue to lead, even if I don't always like it.

Nanci


#### <time> Friday, March 21, 2008 12:54 PM </time>

4:36 PM update...

Ian is awake. His thumb has returned to a nice pink color from being a touch red. His goal is to get decoupled from the IV ASAP and he hopes not to use the pain pump. I will likely head home sometime soon and Nanci plans on staying with Ian.

85 out of 100

Nanci and I just finished meeting with Dr. Yak. Ian is out of surgery and recovering. As is common with the human body, sometimes you don't know what you are in for until you are in and poking around.

Dr. Yak is pleased with outcome. In his words, we got about 85% of the way that he wanted to go. Originally, the plan was for Ian's thumb to be pinned in a better position. This was not able to happen today as the couple of times that he inserted the pin to hold the thumb down across the palm towards the pinky finger, it resulted in the blood vessels in the back of Ian's thumb being constricted. No blood to the thumb is not a desired outcome, so the second option for correcting his thumb position will be a series of progressive splints.

Much of the leftover bulk from his groin flap was removed, many of the scars/adhesions were eliminated, and some nice, new full thickness grafts were put in place. Cosmetically, this is also a step in the direction we want to move as his new thumb won't look so out of place. The full thickness grafts were taken from areas right near his current scars on his side, so Ian will not have to deal with another large brushburn type of patch on his leg this time. 

Ian will likely be in the hospital for one to two more days, depending on how his hand and bandage look. This means that he will probably be home for Easter.

All things considered, I would have to say that both Nanci and I are pleased with the continued progress. These baby steps *never* meet what we hope or want, and I think that we are learning slowly how to deal with what we/Ian have been given and move on from there.

Shriners Hospital continues to be an amazing place. I know that we have had our ups and downs the last thirteen months, but the level of caring and the quality of treatment is unbelievable.

I will do my best to post again tonight after Ian has had a bit of time to recover and we have had a chance to look at his thumb.

Jeff


#### <time> Friday, March 21, 2008 3:46 AM </time>

PS (Pre Script) 

Ian was taken back to surgery after a little two year old with burns to his hands. Surgery began around 10; to be over between 11 and noon. JD

Deja Vu all over again...

Howdy friends, family and people who just happen to have found this site by accident! It is now 3 something in the morning, and I find myself back at Shriners. Waiting. Can't sleep. Mind won't shut off. So, down to the family lounge I went, and here I am.

I have done my best to block out a lot of the trips here that we have made over the last year and a month. Yes, this visit is certainly different than those first few. We know what the game plan is now instead of being zombies with glassy eyes and no brains from sleep deprivation and worry. We can understand what is supposed to happen instead of wondering what happened. We are able to potentially see the end in site instead of wondering will this ever end. I had thought that I would be ready for this surgery. I was wrong.

You see, life at the Daniher household had just been getting back to normal, if you can call a house with three teenagers normal. Laundry was being done. Real meals were being cooked. Dad and Mom were able to attend swim meets. Dad and Sean started playing chess on a regular basis. The family would even sit down and watch a DVD together, or maybe catch the series LOST on the computer. Ian was just a teenager, with a girl friend, too many projects, school deadlines, and thinking about what college he might want to attend, when he might get his permit to learn to drive, and what he might do this summer as an internship.

All of these things really won't change, much, long term. But they will, short term. Therapy will be back. Pain for the sake of "getting better" will return. A new routine will replace the just returned routine, at least for a while. This time, I hope that it will be different though.

You see, even as I write these words, I can see the future, see what can be, what will be, even though a lot of it isn't quite crystal clear yet. I can understand that Ian is getting better and that the dance of two steps forward, three back, four forward, two back just is part of the deal that we have. And, in my heart, I know that we don't have such a bad deal. It could have been, as it is for many, so much worse.

As any parent who is reading this can understand, Nanci and I would trade places with Ian in a nanosecond. We would lose our fingers, our toes, our hands, if it meant that he could be spared this. But we can't. No parent can substitute themselves for their child, no matter how badly they want to. In our case, however, we have hope rather than despair. Hospitals seem to be full of both, and you don't know when you walk down the hall and see patients or parents or family or friends whether they are full of hope or full of despair.

I suspect that in another 12 months post accident, that many of these feelings/thoughts/sense of empathy will have vanished. Ian, his family, and friends, will hopefully have moved on. I can see him thriving in college, learning, creating, sharing, teaching, thinking, and hope that he will make a difference in the world by being in the world. And just writing these words have helped me. They have helped me to focus on what can be, rather than what isn't, or won't be. So I feel a bit better now. But, at the same time, I don't want to return to the very selfish existence that I had before Ian's accident.

Even though we (Ian and Nanci primarily) will have some tough times ahead, I know that we can move forward from here. That is a great feeling. At the same time, I have been reconnected, or pardon the pun, grounded again, just a bit. Normal life is comfortable, but it can be in the words of Pink Floyd, also a bit numb. So I think I will return to my not so comfortable bed and try to get some sleep. And I will say a prayer for Ian, for all the caregivers here at Shriners, and for all of you who have been so supportive of us, and for all of the people who are full of despair rather than hope.

If I may, do me one favor. Turn to your date book, outlook calendar, phone, or whatever you use to keep track of your life. Flip to some random date six months, twelve months, eighteen months in the future. Write yourself a note to do something nice for someone who needs something. This way, as "normal" returns, it won't be life as it was, but maybe life as it could be for someone who really needs it.

Thanks.

Jeff

Lost Track of Time

I can honestly say that I don't remember how long ago it was that we were last at Shriner's for a surgery. Sure, there have been clinic visits, but it has now been so many months since Ian's toe transplant that I would have to look at my calendar to know for sure.

Life has kind of returned to a routine, and after this Friday, it will be interupted again. This is Ian's main concern. Just a few days ago, he said to me, "Dad, I don't mind the surgery so much, but I do mind the recovery." 

You see, even though Ian's hand right now looks like a C+ project from a Frankenstein body sewing class, he can at least use it. After this Friday, he will be back to having to regain all of the strength, usage, therapy, (this is a four letter word in our house) and dealing with wounds, grafts and stitches. I hope that this is the last surgery for his sake. It probably won't be, but I can at least hope.

A funny story (at least to me..): Ian attends the Crossroads Student Ministry sessions on Sunday evening. This group attracts a wide range of kids, from those in the local neighborhood, to straight laced bible thumpers, to computer geeks, to preps (is this word still used?) to Goth/Emo types. A couple of weeks ago, Ian mentioned that a Goth wanna be, dressed all in black with corpse colored makup came up to him and said "I heard you have a scar..can I see it?" Ian said it was fascinating to watch her reaction when he showed her his hand. What little color was in her face completely vanished, and a small "oh" uttered form her lips. "Thanks" she said as she hurried away.

I guess some chicks don't dig scars.

More to come later this week. Thanks to all of you who still have our family in your prayers.

CHANGES ARE A PART OF LIFE...

Due to the nature of work at Shriners Hospital, surgeries are scheduled and rescheduled based on the needs of the most critical patients. The acute unit has been very busy, so the schedule has been thrown off a bit. Ian's surgery has been moved back a week, to March 21st. Unfortunately, he will likely miss at least a week of school.

Life goes on....

In the meantime, Ian has measurable pinch strength in his new thumb. Once it is straightened, that should increase. Ian continues undaunted by his unique challenges. He's back in the game, and competing full-steam ahead on all fronts. This includes going to a dance with his very sweet girlfriend last month.

Ian's current focus is ACT/SAT prep and working toward the Science Olympiad State competition (CHCA did very well at regionals, thanks to Ian and his teammates!)

He also continues to participate in INTERalliance, a wonderful Cincinnati IT program involving area kids in the excitement of problem solving...and a discovery of all the shapes that "Information Technology" can take in world commerce and everyday life. Ian has been a one-man team representing his school well...one win and two near misses at the most recent events.

Stay tuned for more updates in the next few weeks.

Jeff's impressions of Olin College. 

Stuff in quotes are comments that I overheard...

Kids learning just for learning. Taking apart stuff. Asking questions. "What do you do in that class? Oh, that is cool. Hey, gotta run because I have some school work to do and I better eat before the cafeteria closes."

Four kids sitting around discussing how to start up a repair committee to fix non functional OLPCs.

"That is cool. Can you make a dinner meeting? Just check my outlook…

Hey, did you notice that Mel has written two blog entries between when we last saw her and an hour ago?

Would you put those screwdrivers back in the supply cabinet when you leave? Sure!

Better make sure that we power those on before we take them apart…

Look, here is a (technical term inserted here) that is not put into play yet?

Say, did you notice that they fixed this in the second version? Really, let me see that?

They have to come up with some better system of batteries, as they are just not very good. Sure, but Lithium still is the best material. Maybe I will have to come up with something else.

I am incredibly jealous of the supplies that you guys have…"

The dress code? Cool t-shirts and tennis shoes. Gotta have tennis shoes. If your shirt says something in geek, like “snakes” followed by some Greek Symbols (which means on a plane, snakes on a plane, get it?) or “engineers reduce stress through necking”, even better. If not, just wear some type of Olin spirit wear..

At meals, the tables fill up with newcomers taking up open spaces, not moving to a new table until each other one is nearly filled. Hello. Smiles. In such a small school of 300, everyone knows everyone. Most kids have nicknames based on email handles. Do you know if I Google my name a Canadian country singer comes up (and a bad one at that?)

In many ways, I have visited the twilight zone of cutting edge education. Think letting a group of homeschoolers with unlimited resources, surrounded by like minded peers with state of the art equipment. About half men, half women. A hodge podge of m&ms of ethnicity. 

Oh, did I mention that the school is free? All you pay is room and board…The challenge is that there are ten times as many who apply as can get in.

"I don't do much with nerf guns, but I like taking them apart. Look, here are some pictures of the hack-a-thon.

Will they ever get that player piano to work with midi files? Right now it is really slow…"

Gotta go grab some dinner, and then try to pry Ian away from this place. He used to say that if he ran away from home, he would head out to a friend of mine's welding shop in California. Now, I would put the odds at 75% that he would make his way to Boston. At least until we visit the next school…

Inside Ian's Mind

I am not sure that this entry will make sense. It is going to be my best shot at having a play by play about Ian's visit to the headquarters of One Laptop Per Child...

Some months ago, almost 12 to be exact, Ian was lying in the bed at Shriners. He got this look in his eyes that we have seen so many times before. He was looking at some of the wires that were connected to his body, and then at the machines. I asked him what was up. He then launched into a short explanation of how it might be possible to make wireless connections...and this led into his exploration of designing peripherals for One Laptop Per Child PCs...

More to follow...  

#### <time> Sunday, February 10, 2008 3:01 PM </time>

Countdown

Well, we are in the home stretch before Ian's next surgery. As March 14 approaches, Ian continues to watch his grades and diligently approach his work. In honors Physics, he and his friends are disassembling lawnmower engines for classwork. He is like a kid in a candy shop! As an aside, his attention to this project has caused him to delve more deeply into the question of how to make his left hand do more useful labor in day to day things.

On Friday night, Ian hung out with some guys and had Little Debbies, Pop Tarts, and orange drink for dinner. Now this is high school! Seriously, he hasn't had many days to just hang out and have fun with the guys.

Saturday Ian took time to play video games with his brother, who has had the full fledged flu for 5 days.

I think Ian finished Academic Team this past weekend, and he has a few events to participate in before completing the Science Olympiad "season".

In between there, Jeff and Nanci take a weekend off to go to Arizona, and Ian will enjoy CHCA's winter dance.

Life goes on.

Surgery will follow. We appreciate everyone's prayers for a once-and-for-all fix to getting a functional thumb.

Our church just started a new series about the challenges of being distracted by consumption vs. living purposeful lives consumed by a desire to do good...God's work...in the world. We, the Danihers, have lived much of the last 3 years in a holding pattern. This journey we are embarking on with our church seems particularly appropriate as we turn our attention to the question "What next?"

What would we do without parents? Ok, I know that the header above can prompt many flip thoughts, such as "we would not be here", but I am asking all of this blog's intrepid readers to ponder this thought for a moment. Think about it again. Can you name any species that spends so much time dependant on the care offered by the mother and the father? (I should note that this entry in no way is meant to omit those single parent families, or be mean to those whose parents may have died. I have to write things from my perspective, hence this topic.) I am still regularly asked how is Ian doing. I don't have much in the way of new news, and my response usually concerns his being a teenager, dealing with school, a girlfriend, peers, getting his learners permit, preparing for college, both visits and exams, and bugging his mom and dad about allowing him to get a job. Not that he has much time to work on extra chores around the house, mind you, but in fairness to Ian, he is better than average on the last topic. (OK Ian, I said better than average, but not perfect...try folding and putting away your clean clothes please. And your bedroom...well, let's not go there!) What I am less likley to respond is that I have no idea how anyone can raise teenagers. I mean, come on. Is there any more demanding, know everything, temperamental, emotional, crisis loving and crisis creating age group? For those of you how have survived this time, how did you do it? I remember being sleep deprived when the kids were infants. Now Nanci and I are sleep deprived, social life deprived, and our wallets are readily drained of folding money to an extent I did not dream possible. Teenagers eat like goats (everything and in large quantities), expect to have the latest and greatest technology (but Dad, all my friends have their own cell phones....and unlmited texting), outgrow their clothes (must also be the \*right\* clothes) faster than Cincinnati weather changes, and have schedules today that make my head spin. Why? What is the purpose of this? Is it some type of cosmic pledging process that God created to show his sense of humor? Is there a special fraternity that we get to join after one has teenagers "grown" and out of the house? Do you not get to join if your children boomarang back into your basement between college and "real world" work? Hey mom and dad, how did you do it? Was I like this? I don't remember being this way. I do remember how smart you became once I graduated from college, and I thought that I was the one who went away to learn something. (Please don't remind me again about the time that I ran away from home in my socks. Nobody wants to hear this story again, especially me. And no, it is not funny. Really!) Come to think of it, you still are seeming to grow smarter and wiser by the day! And, sometimes I even pay when we go out to eat together, unless Dad reaches for his wallet first. So, the topic of this entry is two fold. First, for all of you teens out there, or wanna be teens (Sean, you still have a few months yet for crying out loud, give us a break!), thank your parents the next time you empty their wallet because you need some cash to go have some fun with your friends. Thank them for driving you around, or for allowing you to use THEIR car and THEIR gasoline. Remember that once we drop you off somewhere, that we often have another period of time that we get to spend on the highway to go back home, and then we get to drive to pick you up again if we have not been lucky enough to coop with another parent to share the joy of driving in traffic. Oh, all that neat stuff you want and can't live without? Well, did you think for a moment that your parents might like to have some of it for themselves? Or that maybe that they need to be saving some money, not just for your education or pleasure, but so that we "don't become a burden to our children" when we retire? Come to think of it, maybe we can get revenge by moving into your basement, staying up late, play our dated music too loud and eating your food! I might have to try this out... Second, for all you parents who are reading this, I have just a few words. Thank you. I never understood what you really did for me, for us. Now I do. And, my gratitude for what you endured is beyond words. With love, Jeff 
Special PS Thank You!

In my blog before the one that I just wrote, I asked if anyone had a spare oscilliscope lying around. It turns out that a colllege roommate of one of my planning buddies did! Thanks John D and Matt G!

What would we do without parents?

Ok, I know that the header above can prompt many flip thoughts, such as "we would not be here", but I am asking all of this blog's intrepid readers to ponder this thought for a moment. 

Think about it again. Can you name any species that spends so much time dependant on the care offered by the mother and the father?

11 Months and Counting

Since February is a tricky month, with 29 days this time, I figured the above title is about right. Hard to believe. Nearly a year has gone by, and so, maybe, an update into the mind of Ian from his Dad's perspective is appropriate.

Ian has always been interested in all things electronic, from the earliest of days. He had buckets of junk parts from old PCs, broken toys, appliances and so on in his room for as long as I can remember. Well, that is not totally accurate. The parts were in his room and spread throughout the house as his projects had a way of popping up under foot, on the counters and so forth.

I feared that Ian would lose his interest after his accident. Nah, not a chance. We continue to battle with him about doing his schoolwork and balancing his extra curricular computing, designing and hacking. Through in time with his girlfriend, his buddies, and other items like academic team and science olympiad and we hardly see him. He hangs out, like many teenagers, in his room, chatting with peers working on the One Laptop Per Child help desk, or his tele-med project (By the way, does anyone have a spare ocilliscope laying around the house or lab?)

Ian's latest school wish is a school called Olin, a newly created school for engineers. Here are two links to check out.  and  For those of you who know Ian personally, doesn't this sound like it will fit him to a T? Now, the question is how do we get him in? Any ideas? They only take 75 students... Should we start a "save Ian, send him to Olin" letter writing campaign? But, I digress...

In any case, his accident and the recovery has not taken much of a toll on Ian's drive and interest level. He is not happy about his upcoming surgery primarily from a standpoint of it will get in the way of his doing the things that he wants to do. So much to do, so little time. Now that he is mostly off of pain meds, his grades have picked up. He will soon be sitting for the SAT and ACT exams and one of these days we will get around to applying for his drivers permit. Yikes. 

Ian is working on finding a summer internship, and recently sent out his resume to a well placed contact that has already come back to Ian with three or four possibilities. Of course, Ian is ready to start now even though he barely has time for the rest of the stuff he has to do (not necessarily wants to do mind you) and Nanci and I are working diligently to develop patience in him. I think it is a little late for this, but we are still working on it!

Have a great weekend!

ALL THINGS NON-MEDICAL

Ian started back to school today on his 2nd Semester of Junior year. He has spent the last week gearing up for this semester and looking forward to summer.

Besides looking forward to driving school....

Ian is checking out options for summer internships. There are many exciting opportunities, both local and regional. We'll keep you posted!

PICTURES

As mentioned often, Ian's hand  

 is a work in process.

Go to PHOTOS section for updates.

On March 14, Ian's thumb will be pinned in a re-aligned position, much of the scar tissue will be removed, and new palm tissue will be added to give better grasping ability.

Hopefully the photos will give some context to all the friends and family who have followed Ian's story and seek to understand "where we are going next".

In theory, Ian should be able to do three new things by summer:

* put his hand/palm flat on a table  

* while keeping his hand flat on a table, he should be able to move his thumb next to his index finger, and then far away in an L shape.  

* touch his thumb to the base of his pinky (at the top of his palm)

With much prayer, skill from the surgeon, and surviving tendon tissue, all this should happen with this one more surgery.

Our backup plan (if grasping is still a problem) would be to have another surgery to give him a better flexor tendon.

If all this goes well, the FIRST thing Ian will do is get his Temp Permits for driving!

*New Year; New Progress*

*Old projects*

Ian continues to enjoy the New Year with friends. He has been to parties and movies with local friends from school, and continues to network with international colleagues working on One Laptop Per Child. Ian has garnered the interest of a mentor in the field of medical electronics development, and continues to have regular phone meetings to plan his professional development. Ian has never been one to let schoolwork interfere with scientific exploration, but he managed some nice grades and study habits by the end of last semester. All in all, his life is shaping up nicely...lots of fun and adventure, and plenty of hard work.

The next surgery will hopefully be the last major reconstruction. We hope to post some current hand photos soon to help you all understand where we are going next.

Your thoughts and prayers are very much appreciated. Our "Merry Winter" cards have not yet been sent. Hope to get a USPS update out soon.

As a side note to all those caretakers out there. I have realized anew that one never knows how far she has sunk until she puts her head above water again. I have once again begun planning and preparing regular meals...a simple, regular "Mom Thing"...only to realize how long it's been since I had the mental and emotional resources to plan nutritional and varied meals for my family! We also got in a few decluttering trips to make donations of charitable "stuff" before the new year. 

Once before in my life, when I had very small babies and toddlers, I remember emerging from the trenches to rediscover shades of what others consider normalcy. 

I cannot help but ponder...almost daily...the thoughts and life challenges of parents whose children have chronic pain, or cancer, or whose children are in heaven. Especially on my heart are those who speak out in their darkness to make a difference.

Wow! 

Thank you, God, for every small blessing!

Nanci (The Mom)

Happy New Year!

Good Morning everyone, or good whatever time it is that you are reading this.

I have been waiting for this day for months now. New Year's Day. Fresh Start. A New Beginning. Last Year Is Behind Us. The Year From Gahena Is Buried In The Past.

Looking backwards, there are freeze frame moments burned into my mind, like You Tube clips. First seeing Ian and his hand and wondering what in the world happened. Running red lights on the way to the hospital. Hearing Ian being concerned over missing turning in his project at school. The trip to Shriners in the ambulance. John being at the hospital before me waiting for us. Dr Y and Dr K telling me that Ian might loose his arm. Andy showing up with bagels and just giving me a two minute solid hug. Smiling nurse faces. All of these memories are from the first ten hours on March 1.

But, this is a new year! Our family celebrated with a meal out last night, enjoying each other's company. Funny, but my family was the only one with kids, but I guess the holiday is really one for adults who have so many more experiences and are fond of remembering and looking forward.

I don't know why I feel like I am a horse who has been stuck in the starting gate while all of the other horses are running down the track. But you know what? Now that the gates finally just opened, I think I will saunter out, and begin a new journey. This one does not lead me in a circle back to where I started from, but takes me down paths that I have no idea where they will come out. Perhaps some will lead down the same path that we went down last year. If that happens, I am ready for it. But I also know that it will lead me down paths where the joy is in the journey and not the destination.

So, as I sit here drinking a cup of coffee that Nanci just gave to me, with Fisk the cat sleeping on my desk between the keyboard and the monitor, listening to itunes, I will bid you good day!

Nine Months and counting...

When I close my eyes and think about 2007, most times it seems that they year has flown past. But I know that this has not been true. There have been minutes that have seemed like hours or days. There have been days that seemed like months, and months that, well, you get the picture.

I really can't tell any of you who are still reading this much more than thank you. Sincerely, thank you. In a small way, but still in a very significant way, knowing that there are others out there that truly care about a boy named Ian, his injury and recovery, and his family, has kept me going when all I want to do is sit down and give up.

This year has been the absolute most difficult one in my life.

Bar none.

And, I wonder when it is going to get better. You know, when I can say April Fools, this really did not happen, our lives are not still upside down in many ways, we can go back to being our normally somewhat scatterbrained selves. But, that is a fantasy. A small child inside a big person's wish. Santa, all I want for Christmas is a power outage on February 28th starting about 11 PM...

Even writing this words make me upset with myself, because how can I be so selfish, you know? After all, haven't I told so many how much this has changed my life, and how much better "perspective" I know have. Well, you know what, I wish that I did not have this perspective sometimes. I wish that we weren't having to continue dealing with a long, slow, still multiple outstanding surgeries remaining recovery.

I want to have a "normal" son, not one who has been to see hand specialists in three different states. I want Ian to be thinking about getting his drivers license, not trying to find a pair of mittens to fit his still in process hand. I want, I want, I want.

So what. Wanting and wishing don't change anything.  

 It is, what it is. And, so I keep going on.

One change in my life though, which, is a side effect of Ian's accident, is my realization of how philanthropy is truly a miracle. You know, people who have something, freely giving it to others who don't and who are in need of it. I wonder what our world would be like if hate could be turned into kindness. If money spent on wars, on power, on "stuff" could be shared with those who did not have so much stuff not because of their choice or circumstances.

When I went into business nearly nine years ago with John, I asked him the question "how much is enough?" Great question. Only I still don't have the answer myself. Do you? If you do, could you share it with me?

In any case, Ian's accident, my exposure to those in far more terrible circumstances than what we are facing, and our experiences, both positive and, yes, negative with Shriners Hospital, have contributed to me looking at things maybe 1% differently. (Gosh I still have a long way to go.)

So, let me end this overdue rant and soul cleansing with a thought. When you are stressing with something, anything, that you want or need, and it just seems to be a big deal, ask yourself what would someone who was worried about where their next meal would come from think about your problem? Ouch, huh?

And then, ask yourself, what you can do to make the world a little better, today, and then give it a try. Let someone else have the parking space at the crowded mall. Toss some change into the kettle, or perhaps, instead of giving a gift of a thing to a family member or loved one, consider donating a mosquito net to a family in Africa whose child might die from a mosquito bite. Gosh, I wonder what they would think of my blog if they could read it.

Well, I know that this has been kind of rambling. I have been wanting to return to writing since Turkey day when a friend of Nanci mentioned to me that she enjoyed my writing. Well, E, thanks for your comment. And thanks for caring. I sleep better at night this way when all I really want to do is feel sorry for Ian and for myself, because the very process of writing down my thoughts and sharing them helps me to focus back on what really matters.

*The Thumper Rule*

Years ago, while trying to corral my toddlers and keep their budding verbal skills in check, I borrowed some help from Disney. Bambi's friend, Thumper, was chastised by his mother for an unkind remark about Bambi's shaky new legs. Mama bunny made Thumper sheepishly recite the rule: "If ya can't say nothin' nice; don't say nothin' at all." This was a mantra I would use often to remind my own children to hold their tongues. It made sense to my toddlers. Who could resist a feisty, furry bunny dispensing advice?

Don't know what it says about my own maturity level, but this was - I think - the subconscious rhetoric going on in my head over the past couple months. I guess I finally got it worked out enough to write again, so here I am.

Thanks to all of you for waiting patiently. I cannot imagine doing the last 6 months without our friends, neighbors, and partners in prayer across the ocean. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you!

Ian's new thumb *did* survive the transfer from its old home on his foot to his left hand. But it did not do so with aesthetically or functionally pleasing results. There are many reasons for this. Most of those reasons involve rediculously detailed descriptions of the complicated hand and foot anatomy, inopportune scarring, combined with Ian's particular injuries. (remember all those unseen internal electrical burns?)

It was hard for either of us to know what to say.

Ian's thumb is attached in a hyperextended position which makes him still a ways away from truly opposable use. (His thumb is permanently hitchhiking) Now that we've made our peace with the "here and now" things are getting back on track. Ian has been truly remarkable in his forward thinking optimism. He is enjoying school and outside projects (always outside projects!) just as much as ever.

Shortly after the first of the year, he will undergo another surgery to stretch and straighten everything. The places where the arteries were grafted will now be strong enough to take such tension. The last of the "corn dog" tissue should be thinned, and he will at last get a palmar surface graft. He might begin to move and function with a complete two hands. At least we hope so.

His hand and foot will likely always be challenged in cold weather, so maybe his career will take him to the tropics!

While waiting for our Cincinnati winter, we do passive and active therapy, as well as electrical stimulation with a portable device to re-train muscles and nerves.

In the meantime we will celebrate this Thanksgiving with a new understanding of family, of the medical miracles in our midst, and a crystal clear appreciation for each new day.

More to come.

*Nanci*


#### <time> Tuesday, October 23, 2007 10:24 AM </time>

Yes, we're still here!

There has been no new news to report. Ian's new thumb is still attached, looks pretty good, but doesn't do much yet. We're waiting and watching.

He has started once or twice daily therapeutic electrical stimulation (ironic, huh?) on his hand. About 3.5 v make the muscles involuntarily contract, and in so doing exercise the muscles and "exercise" the nerves.

Our next appointment with the doc is on Friday.

Welcome back to Academia, Ian!

It may seem somewhat split-personality to read this post after my last. Guess that's just the nature of recovery. Take your moment to grieve; then move on.

Ian has officially returned back to school. He is taking Honors Physics, AP Chem, Honors Pre-Calc, and AP Latin. He will likely take an English course this summer. Right now, that schedule seems manageable, but still exhausting. Ian's foot doesn't like all the new activity. But it isn't getting in his way much...I need to park the car, go into the school, into the science wing, and personally haul him out to the car every day. He's very glad to be back!

In the last few days, we have dealt with localized foot infection (likely from sub-cutaneous sutures) and a metal clip that randomly appeared on his had from his surgery site. Both are within "normal" limits, but both are rather alarming when one is unprepared. At least the suture deal we've seen before. The clips...well, that freaked us out a bit.

Jeff and I had a rather sobering and inspiring luncheon on Monday. The Parents Club for our daughter's school had a guest speaker who had been in charge of the medical team at Abu Ghraib prison. He shared stories of courage, compassion, and heroic actions on the part of his staff. He showed pictures of healed wounded. In every slide, I saw each person as if on re-wind. I know what they looked like when he started. He shared the emotional pain of enduring 36 waking hours of patient care and compassion, only to see CNN report next morning - erroneously - about much that was supposedly wrong with that facility. Most of all he talked about wondering - on return to mundane life in the States - about how to recapture a sense of worthwhile effort after living in one of the world's bad places where men and women are given an opportunity to affect so much change for good. No matter what one thinks about the war, these medical personnel take the wounded - from all sides - and put them back together. That is heroic whether it is near a battle field, or in Shriners Hospital. It is mind-boggling to me how they keep composure and keep doing what they do.

Our family is grateful to be a world away from the acute crisis world we lived in this spring. We have many awesome opportunities before us.

We're just taking everything one day at a time....with gratitude.

*So Far Away...*

Mom here...on an I-can't-sleep night. Having lots of those lately.

Mostly, on the outside, everything is humming right along. Ian plans to go back to school tomorrow. We hope he can take only the most essential classes, and then be able to keep up better through rehab.

He has been studying hard, working in some recreation with friends, and keeping his sense of humor.

But, wow, that goofy video of the guy with the reconstructed hand seems so very far away! We still have so very many unknowns...when will it move? When will Ian be able to have an open palm, allowing his fingers to do real work like type? Will the thmb move? When will it look like a hand? When will he be able to run? Play paint ball? Play Guitar Hero? Ski? When will this end? Will we be doing the same rehab thing during Ian's senior year?

Now, to one who is involved in a critical care or terminal situation, I am sure much of this seems petty. I am painfully aware of this comparison every day. My heart goes out to so many who are in very sad situations.

But I am here. This is our life. As another mom said, there comes that time when you know that you can't put your life on hold - in that crisis mode - any longer. You have to figure out how to keep living through it. I know how to do crisis. I know how to advocate, adjust, and live on triage. I'm not so sure that I know how to live with this very gracefully on a day to day basis. It feels a little like Chinese water torture. Any one drop is entirely tolerable, but the indeterminate repitition of the thing makes it maddening.

So that is where faith comes in. I am generally a detail freak, but not a control freak. I'm usually a kind of go-with-the-flow kind of person. BUT I have reached a few inescapable conclusions in all of this.

I have little control in all this. Ian has little control in all this. ["Keep trying and stretching" is still not control] The whole process is that the surgeon has control over the decisions about what to do...what tendons to connect. What tissue to leave or keep. When to do surgeries. It is a dialogue between Ian's healing tissue and him. WE are largely superfluous to the process. It's a bit disarming, to say the least.

I have seen this helplessness play out in Ian's thoughts in recent days. I tell him the truth...it is our *only option for reconstruction* to go down this path and see where it leads. God will watch over Ian and heal his heart and his body. It is our job to just keep on doing whatever it is we are told, keep asking questions, and keep praying.

"Just" that. :-)Thanks, God, for doing it with us!

Entertainment...sort of

We accidentally found this video while searching for the music video "Mean Kitty" on You Tube. How "eel" and "kitty" are related searches, I will never know. But God can be quite creative when dropping things in your lap.

This shows snapshots of young man from thumb loss to transfer reconstruction. It is important to note that this guy had an intact palm and web space (between thumb and first finger) that Ian did not have on injury. Our doc has had more extensive work to do.

However, you'll get a really good idea of where we're going. This gave Ian some measure of peace to see the whole hand working together. Although Ian's goal is to have a bottle of Bawls instead of beer. He'll have to wait several years for both!

#### <time> Tuesday, September 18, 2007 12:03 PM </time>

*Two steps forward....*

Ok, so I haven't updated for awhile.

We have some good things going on, and some bad things. The bad thing is that the thumb is scarring to the palm...just like it did last time. We are debating a small procedure to set this free, so that we can keep range of motion this time.

This all plays into the complete lack of predictability in the healing process, and hence our family schedule.

Then there is much good news...

...Ian got several visitors this past weekend.

...Ian is doing plenty of homework to catch up. He is nicely getting back in the groove, and his teachers and fellow students have been characteristically WONDERFUL about funneling needed information his way! (Thank you to EVERYONE at CHCA!!)

...Ian is itching to get out and about. He's having the typically mid-winter itch to go somewhere...ANYwhere...besides hospital, home and school. He made it to youth group Sunday night, we've been to Panera for lunch. This afternoon we'll go grocery shopping...oooo, exciting!

...Ian is healing so fast that he will likely be going back to school much sooner than anticipated. He may possibly return before the end of this week! The surprises can also be good ones.

  
Continuing one day at a time,  

Nanci for the Danihers

Progress

Mom here.

We had a really good day yesterday. When we've been in recouperation, sometimes it doesn't take much to feel better. Ian and I went to pick out some protein powder at our local health food store, and stopped at the medical supply store where he picked up some iodine for an experiment. Running errands was enough like doing "normal things" that his outlook improved greatly.

We also got news of several planned visits from friends this weekend...a huge bright spot in Ian's week!

Then Ian completed some Pre-Calc homework...with some assistance from Wikipedia...further proof of the awesomeness of collaborative learning. Ian's success with mastering matrices (his current math challenge) helped to alleviate some of Ian's fears about trying to tackle work on pain meds.

I continue with masses of laundry. Doing home dressing changes reminds me very much of my brief stint doing cloth diapers...it is never ending. The silver lining in this task is that my new washer does the rinse/wash/rinse cycle all by itself, unlike my clunker of years past.

So we continue to try focusing on what IS easy; what IS beautiful; what IS good.

[My apologies to all the English teachers reading this blog. I am aware of my creative punctuation. Please think of it as more of a poem than a narrative. Yes, I taught my children proper use of English conventions. I just use much poetic license in my blog and email writing!] 

Have a wonderful day!

You want me to wait HOW long?

So, here we are at home trying to dive back into life.

We had these expectations about THE reconstruction surgery. We expected further "tweaking" outpatient surgeries, but fully intended to have an approximation of a hand when we left this month. Our adjustment now is that Ian has another 3-6 months (maybe...it is always a temporary trajectory when Doc is calling the shots) to have this bulbous thumb base hanging around before it is de-fatted more and we get closer to our goal.

Ian is sore, tired, and disappointed in the present circumstance of his hand. 

He is taking enjoyment in our poodle mix and all the cats who are happy to have him home. Happily, although the foot is sore it looks great and will quickly become a non-issue. His donor site on his leg (right next to the old one) is repairing quickly. Good thing, because they are not fun. (Imagine 32 sq. in. of really bad road rash)

We're off to investigate homework.

One day at a time....

With a little help from our friends...

This entry is likely to be short and sweet. There are so many people who have been giving, giving, giving to us. Those who have had us on their prayer lists. Those who have asked what they can do. The friends and family who have dropped off a meal, or done a load of laundry, or passed along a message, kind word, or thought.

Thank you.

A very special thank you is due to the folks at Ritter Daniher Financial Advisory.

We love you guys! Thanks!

Jeff

Oh, by the way, Ian will be coming home today. But that is secondary to the thank you to everyone who has been helping us out.

Visitors Welcome!

After today's good news, Ian wanted me to pass along that if anyone wants to stop by, that tomorrow or Sunday would be great. Ian is looking forward to going home but still needs to cool his heal (a bit) and be careful not to bump his hand.

I have to admit that I am in a bit of shock as I was really not prepared for the good news that we received today. I know that it will sink in as my sleep debt is slowly overcome, but right now I have to admit I am still holding my breath a little bit. I guess it is something that we have been through before and not being able to influence how Ian heals, I just have to keep turning it over to God.

Thanks, God, for today's gift.

Jeff

P.S. This is now our hundredth entry since starting this blog last March. There have been over 10,000 visits to this site since then. We can't thank you enough for your care, love and support.

Surprise. Surprise. Surprise!

Gomer sure would be smiling today. Doc went in to remove blue, necrotic tissue on Ian's left hand. We hadn't looked at it for about 24 hours, since we knew it needed to be cleaned up regardless.

Doc found skin turning pink! There is still some top layer damage (like a bad sunburn) but the underlying tissue has found vascular connections. Yippee! Doc has seen this before, but not exactly often.

This means....

...Ian didn't have tissue removed from his hand that could have presented more cosmetic and functional issues later.

...Ian didn't get another skin graft today...no new donor site pain.

...Ian won't need any more surgery this month to fix grafts or tweak the repair.

...Ian's next surgery won't be for 3-6 months.

...(Ian's one spoiler) Because of vascular issues, Ian is forbidden from caffeine in any form. Bye, bye Bawls. (He also can't go to places with second-hand smoke, but that shouldn't cause gnashing of teeth)

Just when you think life is too crazy and unpredictable, sometimes you get thrown a bone. We are grateful for God's goodness in providing us with healing (a miracle?) and the wonderful care Ian continues to receive here. The vibe here is all about service and giving.

Wishing all of you some good news today, even if it is something small.

Addendum: 

What DID they do today? When will Ian go home?

I got these very good questions today, so....

They took Ian back to the O.R. under anesthesia, discovered the more healthy tissue, then cleaned up all his surgery and donor sites (as long as he was already out cold). He was quite grateful to be asleep for all that! Ian will remain at Shriners for the weekend, to keep an eye on the improving tissue. As long as we get no new surprises, we expect he will return home Monday or Tuesday of next week.

What is normal anyway?

Hi folks. Just me again with some ramblings. Partly about Ian, but partly about life. Two things have struck me in a big way in the last day.

First, a friend who is also having some challenges with her daughter's health, dropped me a line to tell me that she appreciates my writings about Ian, and that Ian and our family is in her prayers. I won't go into any details, but suffice it to say that some of the things that she has been going through make me very humble that she still has time to care about others, like Ian and the rest of our family. Wow. Like Wayne and Garth say "we are not worthy" and yet, I am encouraged and uplifted because in the midst of her troubles she has the time to tell me that our family is in her family's prayers. How about that?

Second, I have another friend who is also going through some different types of challenges. I have tried to say to him that this too will pass, and that while it is OK to feel stressed about what is going on, at the same time, this being stressed about "just life" is nothing that is going to go away until his attitude about it changes. It is like one of those pictures where you look at it one way and see one thing, and when someone tells you that you can look at it another way and see the other pictures within, like the one that has two faces or the lamp, or the old lady contained within, or whatever it was from my psychology books so many years ago. Both images are correct. What you choose to see is what it is, and both can be right at the same time. It won't change until YOUR perception changes.

This last line was also written to remind ME of how things are. I can want things to be different than they are all I want, but wanting so does not make it so. It may sound funny, but I can be ticked that gravity exists but my being angry about it does nobody any good and certainly does not change the situation. I can want to know the mind of God. I can want to argue with Him, and demand answers to all types of things that are unjust, and unfair, and not "right" in my mind. But He is God and I am not. God does not owe me answers. Maybe there are not "good" answers to my questions anyway. So why do I spend so much time and energy worrying about why things are not different when my worry and frustration are not going to change things anyway? 

Sure, I can long for a return to Normalcy. But isn't this just a fantasy created in my mind that never will be anyway? And, isn't Normalcy what life actually is when I am sitting here wishing it was something else? It would certainly seem reasonable to stop trying to change what is, and simply accept it, and then try to deal with what we have, instead of spending lots of time and energy wishing it was something else since all that wasted time and energy certainly won't do anything to change what is, and will keep me from being, here, in the now, and doing what I can do to celebrate and enjoy what I do have. (that is a pretty long last sentence...maybe that is a big conclusion)

So, to my two friends, if you read this, know that I care about you. Know that you are loved even if what you have is not what you want, but it is what you have got, and can somewhat choose how to react to it. This does not mean that it is pleasant, or fun, or even necessarily good. But IT is, what IT is.

Ian is ready for his next surgery. I think that I am as well. 

He had a couple of friends stop by today, and it was good to see him "just hanging" with him. Ian has had lots on his mind, and is very similar to his dad in that he processes lots of things in very deep ways, not always to his benefit. But, in the last few days since seeing his hand, he has seemed to accept where he is, even if he would rather be somewhere else.

To my wife, Nanci, and to my other kids, Megan and Sean, know that I love you. Lots and Lots. And know that that I am proud of you. I know that we have not spent the time together recently that we would like to, but know that I would be doing the same for you if you were here and that I am most certainly glad that you are not.

Great Expectations

I feel like I am getting back into the spirit of blogging. Lots of ideas to write about, some fit for print and some not. The one today is something that we ran into and was about as much fun as running into a wall.

You see, for the last few months, we had "the" surgery of moving his toe to his thumb fixed in our minds as the end. Well, maybe not the exact end, but it was the goal of all that we had been doing. It was the reason Ian was sewn to himself for SIX (thanks, Nanci for the correction) weeks. It was the reason why the flap was done in the first place. It was really the only thing that was keeping Ian from being a normal kid again and getting back to doing normal kid type things.

Well, we had it wrong. I did. Nanci did. Ian did. The surgery last week was a great thing, please don't misunderstand me. We are so appreciative and so far, the new thumb looks fantastic. Even Ian's foot looks really good and if you did not count the toes, you would probably not notice anything being different.

But, the surgery last week was not the end, and there are likely going to be three, four, five more surgeries over the next year. The first next one is to be this Friday, the day that at least in Ian's mind he would be going home and getting back to normal after a short recovery.

Both Nanci and I are completely comfortable with Dr. Yak and his slow and steady pace. We have no doubts that this is still the best thing for Ian, although Ian is currently wishing that he could have just kept his slug thumb and moved on. Our expectations were out of whack with reality in that we had no idea what to expect, except for that "the" surgery would give Ian a new thumb.

The surgery did that. But, at this point, that is all that it did. (Isn't that enough...yes, but remember, this is not what we were expecting...) The new thumb is in the middle of a not very attractive, discolored and swollen remains of his groin flap. Dr. Y explained that he left more tissue than he thought he would need and that he never wants to discard anything that could be useful. In this case, however, some of the flap won't be of any benefit and it will need to be removed this Friday in a procedure that will likely take about an hour.

Like I said, Nanci and I understand, and we are ready, willing and able to do what is necessary to make sure that Ian continues to have the opportunity to be a normal high school kid. Even if it means that he repeats a semester. Even if it means that he repeats a year. I would rather that he have every opportunity to do what a 16 year old could and should do as part of growing up than try to compress this all into a mash of catch up and keep up. That won't serve anybody's purpose.

Ian, however, is the one in the bed, and the one whose feelings really matter. So, as you can imagine, Ian is a bit blue right now. He is having some challenges focusing on what has gone right, which is that the thumb is healthy and will very likely turn out to be just what he needs...but not until some more work is done. And that is the hard part. I can completely understand it as it is similar to one of my favorite prayers. You know, the one that says "Lord, give me patience, right now!"

Speaking of prayer, if you would add "peace and patience" to the list of things that Ian needs in addition to a complete healing and to caring nurses and doctors. He certainly has the last few, but could use some more of the first.

On one small but still amazing note, nearly 10,000 hits have been received by this page since we began it back in March. Amazing. Thank you so much to all of you who have cared so much about Ian and the rest of us. It blows me away.

Yes, but...

I am going to ask for you to think about some things. In your face kind of things. Stuff we don't want to think about. Hard stuff. Messy stuff.

When you are having a bad day, when somebody cuts you off in traffic, when your air conditioner dies and it is 99 degrees outside, when your cat barfs on the carpeting (again), when... how is it that you choose to react? Do you get mad? Do you get angry and curse your bad luck?

Well, next time, think about the young lady here at Shriners who now has no feet. She can't have a toe to thumb transplant; she has no toes. She has one finger on one hand, and a couple of fingers on the other. She did nothing wrong. She just got sick.

She has been here all summer, and still has no idea when she can go home. She is miles away from friends and family. What type of day do you think that she is having and do you think she would be glad to trade with you?

It is hard to ignore her. She does not fit the easy model of "well, they brought this on herself" or "she chose her course". She got sick. Period. She did not DO anything, she just was. And you know what, she still is.

Life is not fair. Stuff happens. So, here are is my question. What are each of us, yes, you and me, what are we doing to make the world a better place? What did we do today? What opportunity did I pass up because I was too busy, or it was not convenient? What can I do tomorrow? Will I do it, even if it is hard, because it is the right thing to do?

Yes, I know that it may be too much to ask us, in our busy lives, to toss it all and be selfless for others. Is it too much to ask to do it one day a month? What would the world be like if we (yes, I include myself in this) made an effort to give away some of ourselves and not just our money one day a month? 

My thought is that the world would be a better place than it is today.

Thanks to those who are already doing this and much more. You HAVE made the world a better place for Ian and our family, and I just wanted to tell you that.

Jeff

*Looking good!*

The dressing change went well. Ian's arm is now in a splint, and down from the sling. How cool to be able to move without an IV pole in tow! The protective splint will keep his thumb from being bumped.

Doc gave Ian a B+. Great foot. Great thumb. Other hand tissue has a ways to go.

He has the new thumb, and about half of the "corn dog" remaining on his hand. The tissue is just kind of parked there until the current surgery settles in a bit. Doc will likely take Ian back to the O.R. before discharge to remove some of that tissue that's looking a little unhealthy. Right now we're waiting for it to demarcate between what is healthy and what needs to go. As soon as we get that guideline, he will go in and clean it up.

Then, he will likely come back in a month or so to get more cosmetic re-arrangement done. Guess we weren't as close to the end as we thought.

All in all, however, Ian is rolling with it. We're trying to keep our minds on the end result.

Later today, Ian will get up and walk around. His foot looks fantastic. There is a suture line, but no inflamation or redness. You honestly have to do a double-take to realize it's short one digit. Ian was quite pleased, as he had been most worried about changing his healthy foot. We are thankful for every smooth transition.

Right now, Ian is sleeping off the meds they gave him for dressing change. Then he'll head off to teen room for a game of Wii.

Ian is so blessed to have the opportunity for a second chance at a thumb. When I sit and think about it, all I can say is "Wow!"

Til later...Nanci


#### <time> Monday, September 3, 2007 7:32 PM </time>

*Freedom...*

Ian's IV line was getting old, painful, and leaky, so it was removed this evening. Yay! Ian now has a comfortable right hand for using his laptop, the TV remote, and feeding himself. Now he better eat and drink so they don't have to put a line back in!

Tomorrow (Tuesday) will be the first dressing change, with the doc on hand to check on his work.

Progress is, I think, always slower than we would like. I was just talking with another 16 year old patient who confirmed how much a stint in Shriners does for your sense of patience. She has been here since May. Now, if only we can carry that humility into our daily lives....

Nanci

Moving Forward!

The first 72 hours since surgery have passed, and Ian's new thumb continues to have solid circulation. Excellent!

Jeff spent the afternoon at home with Sean who was not feeling well (sore throat) and was quite bummed that he could not have a play date with a new friend from CHCA. They were able to connect for a while online by both logging into Runescape. Sean played for three straight hours while Jeff worked on some ebay stuff that has been sitting around. So far, there have been three trips to Salvation Army and more to go. What is small and liquid has been listed on eBay. I thought that I was working up a sweat until I went and checked on the thermostat.

It was 85 outside and 81 inside. Hmm. I called the service people who were just here "tuning up" our furnace three weeks ago. Since it was a Sunday, it was time and a half to tell us that, after 10 years, the compressor has crapped out and the whole thing needs to be replaced. Great. Oh well, at least it is getting cooler at night so we don't have to rush right out and get a new one.

I was finally making my way back to the Hospital with Ian's requested shrimp alfredo from Red Lobster. It sounded good to him, so I picked some up. La La, La La, I was driving down I 471 on the way to Shriners when traffice came to a complete standstill. Across all four lanes. Solid. Not moving. Not at all. Why? Well the 40th anniversary WEBN fireworks, that's why. I got a great seat from the middle of the highway, the kind that many people would pay money for. Not bad for a pyromaniac like myself. Sitting in my car, eating the salad and some of the rolls, watching the fireworks. I don't think that many of the 500,000 on the banks of Ohio were as lucky as I was tonight.

Ian chowed down on some of the noodles with plenty more for lunch tomorrow. I think that he will be glad to see some of his friends, so feel free to stop on by. I will likely be here until mid afternoon when Nanci will take over. I may not be sleeping continuously all night, but at least I have AC!

Making lemonaid!

Jeff


#### <time> Sunday, September 2, 2007 4:49 AM </time>

Nearly there...

Just a few more hours to go until the first three days past surgery are up. Ian's new thumb continues to have excellent blood flow. His foot still is sore, but he has been able to move a bit. The only challenging area now is getting him to be able to go to the bathroom in a prone position, which, if you think about it, is not something one usually does. This should not be a problem for much longer as in a few days Dr. Yak wants him to spend more time upright.

He had a pretty decent night although he still isn't hungry and eats only to stop the nagging. This will also likely change as he moves more.

Oh, good morning!

Jeff


#### <time> Saturday, September 1, 2007 4:41 PM </time>

*He moves!*

Ian got off his IV pain meds today, and is in a mobile chair. His hand is still attached to a sling on the IV pole, and the IV is still in for antibiotics, but he's making progress in the right direction.

His lungs are still trying to make it back from his 7 hours under anesthetic, so getting him up and moving is important.

When I left Ian and Jeff at the hospital, they were both in the lounge area, chuckling and cringing over a silly VH-1 special. Anything featuring Weird Al has to be good for at least a smile!

I'm sure he'll be up for some visitors tomorrow and Monday. Pretty much, the timing for hospital routines and Ian's teenage schedule puts his best visiting hours between noon and 8 pm. Some days he's ready earlier, but that's about it.

Eating continues, so we hope he bounces back well.

Nanci


#### <time> Saturday, September 1, 2007 7:54 AM </time>

*12 hour night*

After Ian ate his snack at 8:00 last night, he closed his eyes and hasn't moved. The doc hopes to get him at least moved to a mobile stretcher chair today, and we hope for more food intake so we can switch him to oral pain meds, and off morphine.

I had a long talk with one of the nurses yesterday about the tenacity of the survivors that come here. They grow up here, because of frequent release surgeries (like a skin "alteration" to let out the graft skin and let them grow more) and other adjustments. Some of them bring their kids here to visit the nurses they have come to know and love. The survivors seem to "get" what many of us fail to...live every moment with gusto. Most of these kids seem to gain a depth of understanding uncommon for their age.

Ian surely has worked through many lessons just in the last 5 months. I know we're not at the end of the tough times, but I am proud to see how strong he has been...and the sense of humor he has had through almost all of this.

Although Ian can have some visitors today, there is no guarantee he will be awake when anyone arrives. :-)

*Zzzzzz.....*


#### <time> Friday, August 31, 2007 4:38 PM </time>

ZZZZ continued

Hmmm. I guess I was more sleepy than I thought. Naps are nice. Ian's has been nearly 24 hours long. What teenager wouldn't want to be where he is, minus the surgery of course...

The next step is to get Ian eating. We have some food planned for him so that he does not have to make the decision himself.

It is kind of boring, but in a great way. I have had lots of time for prayer and for being thankful for this hospital and medical providers in general. Thanks to all of you who are so giving with what you do!

Jeff


#### <time> Friday, August 31, 2007 2:07 PM </time>

*Nap Time...zzzz....*

Ian and Jeff are at the hospital snoozing. They are in the zone where one gets sleep solely in increments of 20-45 minutes. Ian at least has morphine as his sleep aid. Jeff is dragging a bit. I will go in and sleep there tonight.

Ian's morphine is working so well that his respirations dipped a bit, and his heart rate increased to compensate. At least that's the way I understand everything. So, they have him back on oxygen to allow him to rest more, and stop setting off the oximeter alarm.

Visits won't be happening much today. We'll see about tomorrow. The docs want him as still as possible for the first 72 hours, when the veins and arteries get busy with their job of adjusting. The doppler continues to  very nicely.

Will keep you all posted on his progress. Cleaning calls me. I'm waiting for Sean to come home, and then I'll take Meg and Sean to the hospital to listen to the whoosh and say "Hi" before Jeff goes home.

Nanci


#### <time> Friday, August 31, 2007 5:51 AM </time>

Surgery plus twelve

When Ian is not sleeping, he is now conscious. And in pain. And grumpy because he is not yet allowed to have anything to drink. The reason for this is that if (and I am knocking on wood while I type this) there were to be any clotting, he would need to go back in for surgery ASAP. So far, however, the blood flow in the new thumb is terrific. 

The blood flow is checked by using a doppler. For anyone that has listened to a doppler of a not yet born baby's heart beat, this is the same soft wooshing sound that we want to hear from Ian's thumb. It is very soothing to hear the heart beat and flow of blood in the new thumb. Yeah.

Ian slept pretty well last night. He has the power of self medicating through his IV and has done so a bit. About one AM was the first time that he was aware enough to ask questions about how things went and I was able to tell him. He seemed pretty pleased.

Speaking of being pleased, I am going to sound like a broken record again about Shriners for just a few minutes. These people know their stuff. And they care. That is definitely a winning combination.

Now, the other question that is likely on people's minds is "Is this Ian's last surgery?" The answer to that question is almost certainly a no. Dr. Yak was very happy with the outcome as of last night, but did mention that additional cosmetic surgery is probably going to be needed. It will all depend on how things heal. I think that I will wait a while before I tell Ian this news...

Jeff


#### <time> Thursday, August 30, 2007 10:11 PM </time>

*Goodnight. Sleep Well.*

I understand from phone messages that the 4:55 posting (immediately after Ian's voyage to his "recovery room" and our talk with the surgeon) posted to the website, but did not send out automatic emails. My apologies to anyone awaiting the email notification....it must have been a glitch in the CaringBridge servers...we didn't do anything new and different.

I haven't seen Ian since that post was written, but I just talked to his nurse. Ian got the oxygen tube out of his nose as soon as he awoke enough to say "What IS that thing in my nose?" and everything is good from there. Ian will be still for a few days. 

One of the "good news" things for him is that his dressing won't be changed until next week. The doc does not want his hand or foot bothered. Yay for no poking, prodding and cleaning!

I left Jeff "on duty" to sleep the night away with Ian. I got to go to the middle school and run around trying to find classes and teachers. Geez, now I'm going to have more of those "Can't find my class and the bell just rang" nightmares! Just as long as I don't have the ones where I'm sitting for an exam I haven't studied for...Oh, yeah...I live that nightmare raising teenagers!

Our dear friend Judy brought the kids dinner (I just had mine 15 minutes ago...yummy!) and kept the kids in line doing homework for awhile. We all survived the day healthy and pretty happy. Thanks, God!

Have been up since 4:30 am, so I better scoot to bed. Have to get up with Sean tomorrow.

Love and thanks to all of you,

Nanci

3:15 Update

Microsurgery is now complete on the transfer. Dr. Y just had a nurse call down and it looks like there is about another hour to go. They still have to thin down the "slug" part of the thumb, and reconstruct some of the webbing and such. Ian is doing well and so far, everything looks great.

Nanci and I are both doing well. She went home to work on somethings around the house, and is now back again. I have been busy this afternoon with ebay, my ipod and other brainless activities to keep the time moving. And lots of small prayers for the docs and nurses that they stay fresh and focused!

Jeff


#### <time> Thursday, August 30, 2007 4:55 PM </time>

This Little Piggie...

Ian is out of surgery and is recovering in his room. His new thumb is pink and the doppler of the pulse in his new thumb is loud and clear.

The next 72 hours is critical for the healing in the thumb. The microsurgery attachment (done under 20 x power!) is excruciatingly time consuming. The needle and thread can go through any hair on your head. 

Ian is completely "out of it" and will remain this way for the rest of the day. I will post more info about when visitors might be allowed to stop by as we know more. His thumb is exposed and elevated so be prepared if you stop by. Also, if you have a cold or are not feeling well, please don't deliver your greetings in person.

Thank you for all of your prayers and support. Dr. Yak said that things went very smoothly and better than he expected (one of the smoothest he has ever had) but the next 72 hours are critical.

TTFN.

Jeff


#### <time> Thursday, August 30, 2007 11:59 AM </time>

Noon Update....

I just received a report that Ian's surgery is progressing well. The toe has been "harvested"...(jeez, makes me think that it is a peach or something, but oh well) and Dr. Y was closing up the foot. I would give nearly anything to actually see what is going on. But, instead, I am killing time designing a new website. I tried working, but have a severe case of ADD.

Things are on or ahead of schedule. Will let you all know when I know more.

Jeff


#### <time> Thursday, August 30, 2007 4:35 AM </time>

Drum roll, Please....

Mom here. This is it. THE day. I awoke ready to go at 4:30. Those who know me also know this early-bird routine is quite out of the ordinary. Waiting for coffee to brew, and then I'm on the way to the hospital.

Ian decided he wanted a good night's sleep and that did not include snoring parents! Probably a good call, but I still want to be there when he opens his eyes. He had a wonderful nurse yesterday, who should be his post-op nurse.

Ian goes down for surgery about 7:00. Surgery to start at 7:30. End 6 hours (or so) later. He comes back to his room, but will be treated as in critical care for at least 24 hours.

Thanks for all the prayers.

Close to Home...

The loss of Ian's friend Tony has struck him particularly hard. Ian attended the candlelight vigil last night with Nanci and Ian's friend Alex. I think that Ian was glad that he attended but seems to have a difficult time processing that another person he knows has died. For someone as young as Ian, this was the second "young" person that he knows who has passed away. The first was his friend Kier who died a few years ago from complications of a bone marrow transplant. No one at age 16 should have already lost two people he knew.

Please pray for Ian to have some peace. Now that he is back in school, he is overwhelmed with the magnitude of what lies in store for him...another surgery, up to a month out of school, therapy, and doing double duty to catch up with his previous work and keeping up with his current work. 

On top of this, he wants just to be a normal kid of his age, go to mixers, get his temps, stay up with facebook and just be a teenager.

Thanks everyone for listening and keeping Ian in your prayers. They certainly help.

Jeff


#### <time> Saturday, August 25, 2007 7:17 AM </time>

nearly ALL SYSTEMS GO!

Ian, Nanci and I had our final pre-surgery meeting with Dr. Yak and the fine folks at Shriner's yesterday. Ian had the opportunity to very candidly express his concerns with his doctor. He has been regaining feeling in the grafted skin surrounding his left thumb, and had been wondering if surgery was necessary.

Dr. Y was most gentle with Ian, and explained why he felt that it made sense to continue with the procedure at this time. More importantly, he indicated that if the current graft was modified to make it more of a "thumb" without doing the transplant, then he was making any future surgery nearly impossible. And, while the toe to thumb transplant has risks, they are relatively minimal. I believe that Dr. Y said that of the 35 or so that he has been involved with, only one has failed. 

Here is the information that we have at this time:

1) Ian's second left toe will be used instead of the one on his right foot. The left foot had much better blood vessels when the doppler was done.

2) Ian will likely be in the hospital for 8 to 10 days. It will depend on his healing.

3) Ian will "walk" out of the hospital. He will not be in a cast, but will likely be splinted on his hand and will have a heavily bandaged foot. 

4) The first four to six weeks is critical as the bone graft will need to heal before much therapy can be done.

5) Ian will likely be out of school for about a month, and then can begin short days as he feels up to it.

6) The recovery process for the nerves will take about a year or more. The nerves should regenerate and reconnect over this time. The goal is for him to have a fully sensitive thumb that will allow him to pick up a small coin from the floor without looking at it. His current graft, even if minimized, will never have this type of nerve concentration.

7) Ian will have yet more skin grafts for reconstruction. While much of the skin around his thumb will be used in the reconstruction process, it is also thicker than what is normally on the hand.

8) The pin in Ian's thumb will be removed and most likely he will not need more hardware embedded. This depends on how the toe/thumb fit together.

Our plan is that Jeff will be with Ian at the Hospital round the clock through the weekend after surgery, and then will be spelled by Nanci. I would suspect that visitors will be welcome Sunday/Monday and I will do my best to post his progress on this blog.

Each day is a gift, don't waste it!

Editorial comment: In light of Ian's upcoming surgery, this is very relevant. Tony and Ian were friends. Not as close as they once were when Ian moved to CHCA from CLS, but our family knows the Beard family and knew Tony. With that in mind, I am passing along the open letter from Tony's mom and dad.

It is with heavy heart that I must report to you that our beloved son Tony is no longer with us. The coroner reports that the body found last night has been identified as our son. It has been a long wait through the night &amp; all day today to finally find an answer to this question. At last we know the answer and although it is by no means the answer we had hoped for, it at least allows us to put that particular agony to rest and begin to move down the long road to healing. There are so many other questions that we have, most of which will likely never be answered. We will keep the memory of Tony alive in our minds &amp; hearts as we move forward with our lives. It breaks the heart of each &amp; every one of us that Tony will never grow to be a man, have a family of his own, or even become an Eagle Scout as was his steadfast goal. Still we must content ourselves with the fact that we are blessed to have had this incredible boy, Anthony James Beard, in our lives for as long as we have (Anthony James means "Priceless Friend"). The fifteen and a half years he spent with us were packed full of achievements that we look fondly back on - he lived his short life to the fullest. We will miss him sorely. 

Those of you who knew Tony understand what I am trying to convey. To those of you who have not met Tony or did not know him well, I must say that am sorry you missed the opportunity. 

Our heartfelt thanks go out to everyone who prayed, brought meals, searched, or leant support by other means. The generosity of this community is overwhelming. Many people have asked &amp; continue to ask, "What can we do?". I have at many times been at a loss as to how to answer this question, as I have often in this process been unsure what to do myself. Anyone who still wishes to help may want to consider contributing to "The Anthony James Beard Fund". This fund was established by certain dear members of our family in response to offers of assistance. Burying our teenaged child was not a prospect that we ever dreamed we would have to face. Contributions to this fund will help offset the cost of doing so. Donations can be made at any Fifth Third Bank in the name of "The Anthony James Beard Fund". 

In the days ahead we will be making arrangements for laying Tony to rest. I will be sure to pass on to you the details as we have them. Since we had already planned an event for this Sunday, we would still like to gather for a candlelight vigil in memory of Tony. Since we will not be holding a press conference or search, we will not begin until later. I will let you know the new time in short order. Any letters to Tony would be a welcome receipt. We will most likely inter these letters with him. 

Yours, 

-The Beard Family

Nothing further to be added by Jeff at this time as I really don't have anything to say that can express my sadness for Tony and for his family.

Prayer Requests, please, but not for Ian

Most everyone in Cincinnati will hear that the missing boy scout, Tony Beard, was found dead. Ian knew him from his Covington Latin days. He was a good kid.

Please pray for his family. Please pray that they are surrounded by love and caring in this extremely tough time when things just don't make sense. And please pray for the kids who knew him who will have questions of why that just can't be answered, not in this life anyway.

Thank you.

Jeff

One Week to Go!

Ian returned to school this week. For a week. And then he will be "out" again. Yet, I think this little dose of back to normal has been great for him.

Ian has lots of concerns over the upcoming surgery and really, really wishes it would just go away. For him, I wish that it would go away as well, but I know that much of what he has gone through these last few months in recovery has been leading up to next weeks operation.

Thanks for thinking about him, and for keeping our entire family in your thoughts and prayers!

Happy 16th Birthday Ian!

On another front, we just picked up Ian from the UC Technology camp that he was invited to attend. Ian was voted by his peers to be the man who best represents what the camp stands for. Way to go Ian!

And how is this a good thing?

People have asked me how I have, for the most part, managed to stay so positive during the last six months. I would have to say that part of it is my nature, and part of it takes a bunch of work. Somebody told me that when someone is good at something, they make the difficult look easy. Well, our situation is NOTHING compared to so many others, and, when I get the most tense about Ian's challenges, I do my best to remember others who have it way worse than we do. 

Such as?

The family who adopted a child only to discover that they child won't live even to be Ian's age due to MD.

The numerous family and friends who have their own, far more serious health challenges, whether it is MS, Fibro, Lyme Disease, Cancer, Alzheimers, Depression or .... the list goes on and on.

The people who serve our country in the military, or the police and fireman. Just last week at this time I passed the warehouse in Charleston where the firefighters lost their lives doing their job. How does a child of a firefighter grow up with the loss of a parent?

The innocent "victims" of terrorists. Sure, this is a stretch, as I don't even know these people, but terrorism defies my understanding. I cannot even fathom how one person can hate so much that they can maim and kill innocents "for the cause". How does one cope with the loss of a loved one who was in the wrong place at the wrong time?

The list can continue for pages. I am sure that I have not included some that are more "worthy" than those I did include, but the point is that, for the most part, Ian's accident is not even in the same ballbark as many of the challenges that others live with every day. Or, in the words of one of Ian's friends to his mother, "I don't care what he looks like, he is still Ian." I guess it has been pretty easy for me to be positive when I remember that we still have Ian. 

So, what is all of this about? Well, perhaps our experience with Ian can be a wake up call to just one of you who is reading this. You see, it is so easy to get in a rut and be wrapped up in only what is important to you and yours. Life is full of scheduled items, and days or weeks can go by without looking around at the wonder and glory that is around us. 

Before Ian's accident, I most certainly was busy with trivialities and unaware of the world around me to an extent that makes me cringe as I look back. I was self-absorbed with my needs and the needs of my family to a huge degree without even being aware of it.

Ian is a big fan of the "life is good" clothing line of shirts. I guess that fits, because life is good, even if the particular day or week may not be great at the moment. I really think it depends on how you look at things. I could have easily fallen into what I perceive as the "woe is me and my family trap." But how would that solve the problem or change what has happened? It wouldn't. Realizing that we are lucky or blessed or whatever that Ian's most likely fatal accident wasn't is enough to keep me on the positive side of things.

While I most certainly would never have chosen for this to happen, the simple fact is that it could have been so much worse. And, in a small way, it has been a good thing for me because it was the small whack upside the head that I needed to adjust my mental picture that so many of the things that seemed important aren't and so many of the things that seemed unimportant really are.

Have a great day!

Jeff

The Preparation Begins

As of today's date, Ian is scheduled to have his toe to thumb transplant on August 30th. He will return to Shriners on the evening of the 29th, and Dr. Yakuboff will conduct the six plus hour transplant surgery the next day. Ian has elected to move the second toe on his right foot to replace the damage thumb on his left hand. Assuming all goes well, Ian will have a functional grasping thumb and will only be able to count to 19 without the assistance of his ever present computer.

We are still mostly sure that this will be the date as the anestheseologist wants to look at the results of Ian's cardiac monitor. He has some fairly minor and quite normal irregularites that are found in many teenages. Still, they want to be completely certain that they won't need any special treatment for him during the surgery.

After the surgery, we are expecting ten days to three weeks in the hospital, and likely whatever part of another four to six weeks at home recovery. This is Jeff's recollection of the time frame and Nanci may have more detailed info so we will update it as needed.

The timing is a bit of a pain, as Ian will have just returned to school for a week or two before being out again. As of today, August 6th, Ian is at a technology camp being hosted by UC. It is a residence camp, so Nanci and I will get a few days break from our everpresent and now quite normally acting teenage son. For a while after his surgery it seemed that Ian's parents regained some of their intelligence, but we have lost it again in direct proportion to Ian's recovery. Funny how that works.

I know that the entries have been spaced a good bit apart. I want to thank everyone for their prayers and their support. Nanci and I could not have gotten this far without you all, and it is reassuring going in to this scary procedure that we know you are all still there for us.

The Waiting Game

Well, I have returned. Over the last two months, there have been several times where I have wanted to sit down and vent, but I really did not feel that it would be fair to friends and family to endure the rantings of an overtired, overstressed and generally cranky 42 year old man. So, I typed and deleted the mean messages. The how come this had to happen and when are we going to be done messages.

And I am better now. Mostly.

I would say that we are doing OK, or on a scale of one to ten, about a six. To me, the hardest part is the waiting. It really sucks. But proably not as bad as Ian's therapy, which is a minimum to twice a day and ideally three times a day. Flex those fingers, rub the hand, wrap the fingers. Wash, rinse repeat. Pretty darn boring.

Ok, so I know that things could be worse. Now that we are nearly four months in to it, this has lost a portion of its meaning. The house is trashed. Stuff takes four times longer to complete, and many ideas and plans are on hold. But you know what? I can deal with it.

I am not the one missing two digits, or facing the removal and relocation of a toe. I am not the one that endures the shooting pain of finger flexing, day after day after day. Sure, I was not the one playing with way too many volts and fortunately not too many amps, but that was then and this is now. The difference is I am 42 and Ian is 15. 

It is his time where he should be learning to drive. He should be hanging with his friends (more often) and he should not have lost an entire semester of school. I guess it was a good idea to have him repeat his sopohomore year after all. I can only imagine where we would be if this had happened in his junior year.

To all of the readers who have lost interest, I am sorry for the delay. Ian is doing well, and so is the rest of the family. Feel free to unsubscribe at any time. For those of you still interested, stay tuned. I have some stuff coming up that will likely be mundane and boring, but that is kind of where we are. On hold. In Limbo. But so much better than commuting to, or staying in, the hospital. And so much better than if he were not here. Even if the house is disorganized and the projects take three times longer than they should. After all, isn't life a journey instead of a race?

*Question of the month...*

Last month, the burning question was "Will Ian ever have good mobility in his fingers again?" The scar tissue and grafts on his palm and fingers was pretty tight after his flap was separated. Therapy has yielded good progress, but at a cost of lots of pain. Ian is now taking Lyrica; the same neuropathic pain med I was on last year. It is making therapy bearable. But we can't let up for even a moment. Therapy 3 times a day, every day...if we skip or are late for one session, everything tightens up and it's like going back 5 days!

So the question this month is "Which reconstruction method will we choose for that thumb?" Ian has three general options, and none of them sound fun to him.

Anatomy lesson for those who choose to read...



Check out page two for a L hand diagram. Ian lost the tips (DIP joint and distal phalanx) of his middle and little fingers. There is no really good way to replace these tips. So he's adapting.

A thumb has 3 joints....one near your wrist (basal), one near the palm juncture (MP) and the tip joint (IP). All those bones survived Ian's burn, but the soft tissue that holds the IP joint in place is gone.

Option one (the direction we were initially heading) is to fuse those tip-of-the-thumb bones in a slightly bent pinching stance. Then cover the thumb with soft tissue from a great toe, and add the tendons (from the foot to the thumb) necessary to help the rest of the joints work well. The big toe would be minus a nail (transplanted onto the thumb) but otherwise the big toe would continue to do its job.

Option two, which would give lots better mobility would be to take a second toe (bone and all) and fuse it to the proximal bone of his thumb. (Then add supplementary tendons) This would leave him with a dynamic functioning IP "replacement joint". Taking the second toe off the foot leaves the foot looking pretty average, and very functional. The thing is that a second toe doesn't look very thumb-like.

Option three would give good thumb mobility (that replacement IP joint again) and a good looking thumb, would be to take the great toe, and fuse it to the proximal bone of the thumb. (and add needed tendons). This makes a wonderful hand, but can affect balance and gait. One's big toe does a lot of work for us bipeds!

So our June and July work will be to keep the hand limber, and await a reconstruction surgery. The options weigh heavily on Ian's mind. At the moment, the surgeon thinks the hand won't be ready for reconstruction until maybe August. That's longer than Ian had hoped to keep the “corn dog” around, but we'll do whatever it takes!

Again, thanks for everyone's prayers.

*For all it could've been and all it is*

As Jeff has mentioned several times, this business of recovering from a major accident is a real balancing act. There is always an element of grief for what our bodies are not, and hopefully an element of gratitude for what normalcy remains. There is *so much* to be grateful for!

We've been attending therapy sessions at Shriners regularly (currently down to three times a week at the hospital) with the balance of the three-times-a-day stretches and exercise being done at home. This morning, in our therapist was discussing the struggles of those who sustain face altering burns.

This past weekend, Ian got his first offhanded "What happened to you?" from a stranger. The question was not motivated by malice, and was argueably preferable to uncomfortable, unspoken staring. Nonetheless, these middle-of-the-checkout-line moments are a constant source of adjustment for anyone with physical differences. (I pause to think here of friends with MS, MD, autism, and the like) The general public seems to have an especially visceral reaction for those with facial differences. I found this *wonderful article* to give a tiny window into how many burn survivors face the world. Grab a box of Kleenex and click here:



Ian does not need to make adjustments on this level, but is sure to encounter questions for a lifetime to come. This is a tall order for anyone entering adulthood (isn't plain old adulthood hard enough?). 

As parents, we all would all like to spare our children hurt and suffering. We all know we can't really do that. We take the hurt as it comes. So far, we have had our tough moments, but Ian is on the way to triumph and tremendous growth out of his experience. I am very proud of him.

We are blessed.

The Really, Really Hard Part, Part 3

The journal entries have become fewer, but that is only because there has not been much to say. I mean, how does one talk about the matter where the doctor told Nanci and I that he pinned Ian's thumb, but nobody else at Shriners was able to find any reference to this in the records, and the doctor was on a much needed (and much deserved vacation), and so Nanci had to argue, gently, with the clinic doctor just to get an x-ray to verify that yes, there was a pin in place. How does one talk about this without sounding like a whiner? How does one wish that the doctor that day would have said "I am sorry for not believing you" and offered some type of explanation instead of not saying anything at all? Yet, they are the doctors and we are not. But why was this even an issue? Why, in the practice of medicine is that it seems that when a practioner is challenged that they often get defensive? Nanci and I could care less about whether somebody forgot to record something in a log. What we wanted to know was is there a reason why we could not perform certain therapy movements on Ian's hand to help him along? I mean, after all, we don't know what we are doing and just didn't want to make things worse.

I can and do pray about all of these things. I can and do listen, and encourage, and support when and where I can. And I mess up, and argue, and miss the point, and see things differently and want to hide my head under the pillow and just go to sleep so that when I wake up, the bad dream is all over. But it isn't a dream. And it is not going to just go away. So I pray some more.

This time, I am asking any of you who read this, to say a prayer for Nanci and I, for our family,  for the doctors, and especially for Ian. Pray that we continue to have strength and patience and love and support for each other. Pray that Ian continues with his sense of humor, and, continues to be his gentle, loving self, and struggles forward bravely with the pain of therapy. Pray that we ask the doctors the right questions, in a way that they hear our care for our child, and not be threatened or concerned about rogue parents who think that they know too much. And,  please remember to ask that God be with all of those others whose struggles are so much greater than ours as well, even though right now this seems to be the really, really hard part for us.

The Really, Really Hard Part, Part 1

Ian had his clinic visit at Shriner's today to remove the stitches from his left thumb and side. The removal process was pretty easy and straightforward. The difficult part is that his left hand is in need of therapy as the remaining fingers have limited mobility due to their own injury and the extended attachment that Ian's hand had to his left side when the first flap failed.

So, here is where we are. First and foremost, Ian will be having therapy every day (week days I think) at 8:30 AM at Shriner's hospital. It will not be pleasant. It hurts his hand to have the fingers moved, and his whole body tenses up with the pain. While he knows that he needs to do the exercises, it will become even more of Nanci's full time job to take him back and forth and to change his dressings. Ian will also have his own therapy session at home in the evenings.

Now that the "corn dog" has mostly healed, each of his fingers will be wrapped in a light material called coban. This stretchy fabric will apply gentle pressure to each finger and the big thumb to reduce the swelling. It takes about twenty minutes to wrap each finger and then the hand although we will likely get better at it as time goes along. This will be done probably twice a day. At night, Ian's left hand will be splinted to gently correct the not very good bend in the wrist. To make it a bit more fun, Ian has had difficulty sleeping due to some of his grafts itching. We were given some medicine for this, and we will see if it helps him out. Supposedly all of this is normal.

Now, here is the hard part. Let's say that you want what is the best for your son. You have very little experience in matters of hand reconstruction. When you read material on the 'net, it is hard to determine when somebody has an axe to grind, whether they are competent now or ever were competent then, or are just someone with a really strong opinion. Each writer or specialist has their own belief as to what is best. One person says that procedure A results in possible complications Y and Z. Yet another says that procedure B results in possible side effects, Q, R, S and T, but they may not be as bad as Y, but could be, in a few cases, ten times worse than Z. How do you know what to choose? How, without the benefit of hindsight, do you know that you are making the right or the wrong decision when you are trusting your physician?

(continued in parts 2 and 3)


#### <time> Monday, April 30, 2007 8:58 PM </time>

The Really, Really Hard Part, Part 2

As a financial planner, I can tell you that if you put ten of us in the room, we would likely all have very strong and pretty independent opinions. First of all, some of us might not even consider that the other person is a real planner. Maybe they just call themselves that to sell something in order to make a living? I may suggest that goals could be accomplished one way and somebody else could be equally as passionate in arguing their case based on what they know, what they are good at doing, and what they think is the "right thing." After all, if you are good with a hammer, solutions tend to involve nails. 

Of course, I can show statistics and mathematical examples of why I think I am right. I can talk about my caring for the client. I can talk about my listening skills. Over time, I think that I can show how our team approach is better than the lone ranger approach, and why we are building a company that focuses on service, and continuing education, and investment discipline and how this is all best for our clients. But, when it comes right down to it, how do I prove that we are the best choice? Doesn't it come down to trust? And isn't this very similar with doctors?

In the medical profession, how do you interview more than one doctor without the current doctor feeling that you are trying to second guess them, that you don't believe them? I may be very comfortable when a prospective client interviews multiple planners. To me, this is the way that the person or couple can see the differences between us and our firm and those of another company. It is part of my job to help educate the clients to those things that I believe are important and to offer guidance as to what I think makes a good planner. But in medicine? How do you know that the person you have is top notch, up to date on the latest techniques, and is going to do what is best and most reasonable for my son? And what exactly is "best" or "most reasonable" when you are talking about an injury such as rebuilding a thumb? This is pretty much a specialized area if I have ever heard of one.

Doctors are human. Hospitals are made up of teams of people. It is possible to accept what you are "given" without being a bad parent? By this, I mean, look, we are in Cincinnati where there just happens to be one of the four Shriner's burn centers. Ian hurt himself, and within four hours after the accident, he was already receiving care at Shriners. Yet, his injury, because it is electrical, happens to be a bit unusual, even for a hospital that specializes in burns. Even though groin flap reconstruction has been around for a while, it is still used because most of the time it works out well. But there can be complications of moving part of, or all of, a toe, so how does one make a “choice” that involves pretty significant risks, even when those consequences may not appear for years, if at all? 

Different doctors have different opinions. How do you KNOW, with any degree of certainty, that you are making the right decision? After all, just because we have Shriners here, does that mean that they are excellent in this specialized area? How much do Nanci and I have to become experts in this subject before we can rest easy that we are "doing the right thing?" And, what do we do when Nanci and I do not see eye to eye on every single aspect? We both care about Ian, but she can come to one conclusion and I another based on the very same “facts”.  Do you know that you made the proper choice if results work out? Does this mean that the end justifies the means? And, most challenging for me right now, is where does the trust that God will provide come in? How do I know what is God's job and what is our part???

What is so very hard now is that, after two months, we still have MONTHS of uncertainty ahead of us. I get asked all of the time, by well meaning people, how is Ian doing. Well, how is he doing? Based on exactly what I don't know. I have never met another child who nearly burned his thumb off. He seems to be doing OK, but how does he feel knowing that he will likely miss the entire second semester of his sophomore year in high school? How does he feel now that he is no longer new news, but still has significant challenges in front of him? I mean, hasn't he paid enough already for his accident? Missing school, missing friends, cancelling the family vacation, having painful surgeries, being limited in doing the things that you enjoy doing, seeing your parents struggle with doing the best that they can while still trying to hold together some sense of normalcy for the other two kids? I mean, come on. Enough already. Yet, we may not even be a third of the way through this process.

(Continued from part one and finishes in part three)

*Next steps*

Have gotten some feedback from the pictures, with more questions about how his "slug junior" large thumb will resolve to something more workable. 

Right now, we are beginning the long road of therapy. This includes making sure there is range of motion in all his fingers, and the thumb. We will eventually progress to strengthening the muscles. It also includes splinting the hand to make sure everything heals with ligaments and tendons nice and long, rather than being contracted. We also massage the scar tissue to keep it as soft as possible.

The thumb currently has no sense of touch. It consists of vascular systems, soft tissue, fat, and skin...all borrowed from Ian's belly. Think of it like a lump of clay that a sculptor uses to form his masterpiece!

After 8-12 weeks of softening and strengthening things, he will have a surgery. At that time, they will narrow his "slug" surgically, and maybe use a mini-liposuction technique to contour it. Then they will take a hood shaped piece off (like the outside of a cooked marshmallow or the hood on a trained bird of prey) and exchange it with a similar hood shaped part of a big toe. Yes, they will take the nail and all from his toe. When they take the tissue from the great toe, they will also "borrow" some ligaments and nerves. This transplant will give the bone and soft tissue the ability to fully function like a thumb.

With Ian's hand weighing an extra 1/4 pound and looking like he hit his thumb with a mallot in a Loony Toons episode, it is hard to remind ourselves daily that this is temporary.

Keep asking questions if you don't get it. It is amazing reconstruction, but not easy to figure out how to get from point "a" to our eventual goal.

Clearing up Confusion

I have heard from quite a few people that they do not quite understand the procedure that Ian went through. Would his thumb be pulled out of the flap like the insides of a toasted marshmallow? Would the thumb regrow "normal" tissue while inside of the groin flap? What exactly is a groin flap anyway?

Well, if you want to know more, I have posted some photos of slug junior. The pics are quite graffic, but it is the best way to "show" what Ian's hand looks like right now. It is healing, and it is exactly what the doctor has expected, but it is not likey anything I have seen before.

In about a week, Ian will go back and will have his thumb splinted to hold it apart from his hand. He has been able to get out, a bit, but he still gets easily tired.

Right now, the rest of the family is at church. I woke up in a bit of a funk and just needed some time to myself. I have put on a Newsboys DVD and have been jamming praise songs while I clean the kitchen. It is a beautiful day and a great one to give thanks to God. Perhaps I simply needed some "alone" time. Come to think of it, other than sleeping, I have not had much since March first.

Normal is good...

In preparing for a tutoring visit to school, Ian donned a pair of khakis and his favorite long-sleeved shirt. Wow! What a small thing to make a big difference for the soul!

I guess that's what the next year of rehab will be about...small victories.

Have a great day...

#### <time> Monday, April 16, 2007 8:55 AM </time>

YES!

Ian is out of surgery with a free hand.

Doc Yak had only a few minutes to spend with Nanci and I before heading back for another procedure. He mentioned that what will be the end of Ian's "new" thumb bleed well, which is a solid sign that the blood flow is coming from the hand. I think that this was all of our concern given that the first flap failed.

Ian has very good flexibility in his four fingers while he was asleep. While he may not be able to do much with his fingers at first, the promise is there that he won't have any lasting reduction in the motion of these digits. As a matter of fact, the doc wants us to have him continue working on PT with him right away. Ian will have a light bandage on his thumb for the next two weeks. We don't need to come back to Shriners until this point unless something does not look right. 

In two weeks, Ian will get a splint for his thumb to hold it in position as it continues to heal. We will also learn more about future surgeries during our next visit, although they are unlikely to be in the near future. First he will have to get his grafts supple and smooth and increase the range of motion in his left hand.

Ian has started some schoolwork at home, but it does not look like he will be able to go back to school for at least a few more weeks.

Lucky Number Eight?

Hello. They just took Ian back for his separation surgery. Normally pretty composed before his surgeries, Ian was a bit anxious this morning. I think getting poked, proded, sliced and diced over the last few weeks has made him a bit jumpy at the thought of another surgery. This time, the end is closer.

Ian's parting comments as they wheeled him out... "Nitrous before needles." It gave the nurses a laugh.

More to follow...

Thanks for your Patience...

During the last two weeks, Nanci and I have done our best to try to get our lives back to normal. Or, as normal as we can be with our son sleeping in the family room, needing assistance with his dressing changes, and musing about what is next. During this time, a battle has been raging on and I was hardly even aware of it.

The battle is about what matters. About doing things that need to be done because they need to be done. About letting go of older habits and trying to substitute new ones in their place. About failing miserably, but not wanting to give up, and being willing to share it with you all.

In graduate school, I found myself attracted to the classes on organizational behavior. I was not (and still am not) very good at office politics, but how people and business work was a fascinating subject to me. While a lot from my MBA program has receded to the back of my memory, one quote has stayed with me over these past sixteen years. "People only change when the pain of staying the same exceeds the pain of changing."

We all have our habits, our routines. I know mine. The problem is that I don't necessarily like them when I sit still and look back at them. Usually, in the morning, I can get up, get ready for work, and then I have a choice. I can check email or I can scoop the cat box. You see, in our house with five cats, the three boxes fill up fast. It is my job to take care of them. Yet, in the limited amount of time that I have in the morning, I have to make a choice. My email may contain some treat, some communication from a friend or maybe that special item on eBay has finally been listed. The cat box, well, you know. Most days, it is easy to let the cat box go until I get home because the emails call out to me so much more seductively. But this is just not right.

Or, to shine a light on something even more important, the email versus the children and Nanci. I wonder with teenagers, if half the battle with them is that we want them to remain the compliant children they may have been instead of the emerging adults that they are becoming. As you can imagine, having three teenagers (I count Sean here as even though he is only eleven, he is acting like a teenager) at the same time is a lot like having the litter boxes for five cats. They need regular, proactive attention. If you neglect them, you can wind up with a large amount of % to deal with. And, with a spouse, it is easy to take her for granted and let her deal with the household stuff, since after all, it is "her" job and it is what "she" wanted to do. Yeah, right. I don't remember the part about her just showing up with a baby. It seems that there were two people involved in that decision...

If you stay on target, remembering that the benefits far outweigh the dirty job, doing what needs to be done is not as difficult. Or so I say to myself for a day. Or three. And then it is so easy to slip back into the old comfortable routine and leave the mess to others. So, what is it going to take for me to change? Well, pain. The internal pain of staying the same, of knowing that others are counting on me to carry my part of the load, is ringing loud and clear in my head. Now it is time to do something about it.

Ian goes in VERY EARLY on Monday for his separation surgery. All of us are a bit anxious since we don't know what to expect. What will his thumb look like? How much therapy, besides A LOT, will he need? Will the pain continue? What about the nasty scars that he has? Will he get, you know, the looks from strangers? Will he be able to get back to school soon?

In any case, thank you for your patience, your prayers, and most of all, for listening. This has been quite an experience for all of us, and our family certainly appreciates ALL everyone has done for us. Please keep Ian, and the rest of the Daniher family, in your prayers.

Fondly,

Jeff

*Rounding Third and heading for home....*

The groin flap procedure has one more week before his left hand is finally free!

Ian's 7:30 am surgery lasted until about 7:45 am. They "delayed" the flap by severing some more tissue, but leaving it attached to the groin host site in the middle. Then the doc took out several of the pesky nylon stitches...another plus. Dr. Yakuboff said that Ian had far too much time and effort invested to risk separating the thumb too soon.

Another week of semi-mobility...all for a good cause.

Ian did make it to church on Sunday. It was wonderful to see so many compassionate friends who are praying for our family! We had Easter ham with friends, and watched a bit of a movie before bed. It was a good distraction before surgery.

At the hospital this morning, I saw Chau. She looked so much more relaxed this week...her brother has arrived for a visit, and her aunt arrives to the States later this week from Vietnam. Tammy may go home this week or next. Support of friends and family is so important!

Thanks again to all,

Nanci

*Routine*

Today was a rather sleepy easy day. We needed that.

The blister on Ian's flap yesterday was another one of those non-standard healing things that is still "ok". The doc may think it's ok, but it's still just yucky.

Dressing change took 2 hours this morning. That's about a normal day to get the whole cleanup job done. Then we do it all over in the evening, but usually a bit less thoroughly. Everything continues to heal about like it has been. Slowly but surely.

I spent the rest of the day doing laundry and getting bags ready for the Vietnam Vets pickup on Friday. For those who know me well, you know that laundry is the one area of my life that is out of control 50% of the time. I claim a genetic disorganization flaw, but in reality who knows. :-)

Just add "hospital laundry" of an extra load of towels, sheets, blankets, rags and clothes each day, and you have a picture of my current routine. Getting our old clothes passed on to the Vets will help, I hope, to keep the rest of the laundry more manageable.

We have been blessed with much help and encouragement. I am also grateful for days like today when I actually made some forward progress at getting our lives somewhat together. Yesterday was a "lost day" with 2 hours of dressing change--twice, plus our three hour round trip to the hospital.

Ian was sad to have missed several visitors yesterday also. We had to cancel their visits because they conflicted with the surgeon's availability. He hopes for some company in the next few days.

Easter is just around the corner, and Ian hopes to attend church. Many good people there have been praying and lending support. It would be great for Ian - and all our friends at church - if he can make it. Easter is about celebrating the grace and redemption of Jesus. God's grace has surrounded us these past weeks...through many things that only He could do, and the many people who have cared for us. 

Ever grateful, Nanci

*What can I say?*

We had occasion to look at Ian's "new" fingers today. What a tough moment. Made even tougher by the fact that the protective dressing slipped, and the gauze stuck. So, what do you say to a young man who is grappling with an body change like this, even if it is "lucky it wasn't worse"? Nothing feels lucky when you don't have your old hand back. No words were forthcoming, so I opted for a hug.

Adding to the less than thrilling day, we are going back to Shriners' for yet another appointment to have the doc look at part of his flap. Things change, I am sure, as blood supply changes. We just want to make sure this angry looking part of his wound is in the range of normal.

Ian is doing remarkably well. His sense of humor about all of this comes and goes. I think retaining any sense of humor is a victory.

Love to all, Nanci

Sixth surgery down; \__\_|\_ to go....

First, a quick Ian-ism. As we stepped off of the elevator on the third floor of Shriners' this morning, he declared "Home, Sweet Home!" Indeed, this place has begun to feel comfortable...a place of safety.

Ian had a quick 1/2 hour surgery this morning. Dr. Yakuboff is still pleased with the healing of this flap. He cut the blood supply from the groin (a "delay" of the flap). This causes a slight drop of oxygen in the tissue, which triggers a chemical change. Then the tissue starts looking for alternate blood supply, which would be through the new juncture at the hand. So far, so good.

Ian lost the tips of his middle and pinky fingers to the first knuckle. The doc waited until now for natural demarcation between good and gone tissue. The new fingertip suture sites will not feel too good the next day or so.

Next Monday, we have another delay surgery. If everything looks exceptionally good, he may get a "free" hand again ("dividing" the flap). Otherwise, it will be one more week wait for the final division.

Besides continued good healing, the good news is that we get to go right back home. Ian enjoys care from his nurse-siblings.

We have solved his dietary issues by making him supplementary smoothies twice a day. 25 g protein, lots of calories, fiber from fresh strawberries, and cod liver oil for good measure. Plus, he has been eating pretty well.

I will write more tonight when I've had a chance to talk with him.

*Progress...*

We had a bit of a scare yesterday, with one spot on his groin flap looking similar to the mess we had last week. We went down to Shrines' Hospital for a checkup with Dr. Yakuboff.  . The outcome of our visit was that it's doing fine. We are still scheduled for his surgery on Monday at the crack of dawn.

They will separate just some of the vascular supply from his groin, leaving the new tissue to rely more on the new supply from the hand. One or two more surgeries over the following weeks should result in Ian having a free left hand again.

 Ian got to be a field trip/case study for some residents, too. I have read figures that place high voltage burns at 1% of all burn injuries. Groin flaps are only done in a fraction of those. Occasionally, they are also done in severe burns of other kinds. So, anyway, Ian is something of a novelty.

Along the subject of grieving, we are just ready to be done with treatment…yet, the road is long ahead of us. Ian is mighty sick of having his every moment micro-managed. “Sit up” “Lie down” “Eat more protein.” “Drink more fluids” “Keep your hand still” “Time for a shower…Now…because I said so.” What a drag! Even though I am often the one doing the nagging, I sure wouldn't want to be in his place.

On the up side, we are still able to reach out to other patients at the hospital. Some of them have a way longer road than Ian to full recovery. Did you know that skin grafts don't grow? A toddler who sustains significant burns will need to return for more grafts periodically until he turns 18, and perhaps beyond. The doctors keep adding more skin to accommodate the growing body. We have to wait at least a year after treatment to be in the official volunteer/ambassador group, but in the meantime we do what we can.

I went to school to get Ian's books, and we hope to get some assignments early next week. It will be good to do some of his normal routine, although a full return to school won't likely happen until very late April or the first week of May.

$candal?

The New York Times printed an article about the Shriners organization and some questionable and lax accounting procedures that some of the individual temples have had in the past. I wanted to take a few minutes and toss in my two cents.

First, the Shrine Hospital itself has a very large endowment that covers most of the operating expenses of the hospitals. While it imay be true that only about 2% of the Hospital's operating income comes from member's dues and money raised by the temples themselves, this is nearly irrelevant. The Shrine organization is a fraternal organization and has a mission that includes raising money among its other, more social purposes. It is important NOT to mix the two groups. Money that is donated directly to the endowment fund IS NOT available for "keeping the temple liquor cabinets full".

Second, like any group of people, you will have some who abuse their position of power (hmm...never happens in Washington DC) and others who bust their humps for the good of the cause and are completely selfless in their devotion. Please don't let the media reports taint your view of the Shriners as a whole. We can tell you first hand the life changing differences that their charitable hospitals make. They are certainly a cause that deserves your consideration for support, with the caveat that it may make sense to donate directly to the hospital foundation.

The Better Business Bureau maintains a website [www.give.org][3] which provides information on charities, the adminstration of their funds, and how the money used. The link for info on the Shriners Hospitals is  and it states that the Hospitals do not meet all of their recommended guidelines because they are still in the accumulation phase of their endowment and do not spend as much as they could on programs (not that it is spent on non charitable issues). As a financial advisor, I can't argue too much with the Shriners accumulating funds if it is for continued future services; I have certainly not seen them turn children away, cut corners at the Hospital or do anything other than do their best for their patients. Again, just my two cents.

Just Hanging Out

If it were not for the fact that Ian's hand is connected, and that he can't walk very well, oh, and a few bedsores, this would be a pretty good vacation for Ian. His brother and sister are being nice to him and helping out when they can. His furry buddies keep him company, and he has been able to start reading a few of his geek computer books. If only there were not a few more surgical procedures on the schedule...

Really, there is not much new to report. Jeff is busy trying to get back into the full swing of work. Nanci is trying both to keep Ian happy and run the household. Neither of us have much energy at the end of the day.

Things are pretty boring, but boring at home beats busy at the hospital any day of the week.

Coming Home, Part Two!

Nanci and I had the chance to speak with Ian's doctor this morning. He has been released from the hospital and will be able to continue his recovery at home.

1) Ian's injuries continue to heal. The only thing that we have lost so far is time.

2) Ian will be scheduled for surgery for next Monday. It will be out patient surgery, and the goal is to reduce the blood supply from his leg and so the thumb gets more blood from the hand. If more time is needed to allow healing of the flap, then more time will be taken.

3) Assuming that more time is not needed, then Ian will be scheduled for the release surgery the Monday after Easter. Once this is done, it will be multiple weeks before another surgery will be scheduled allowing Ian time to do physical therapy, recover his strength, and make sure that his hand is completely healed before continued work on the thumb.

The Sucky Part

I am not a grieving expert. Nor do I know the various stages one goes through when facing a challenging illness. I do believe that both contain a stage called anger, and it is likely where Nanci and I are right now.

Anger is not exactly the correct word. Maybe it is better defined as simply wishing the whole thing was done and we could start to move forward. Instead, we have Ian who still has a great deal of pain giving us fourteen different types of grief when we try to change his bandages. Instead, we have Ian pretty devestated (although he puts on a brave front) when he actually got a good look at the end of two of his fingers. The tip on his middle finger and his pinky finger are self amputating, and he will likely lose them to about the first joint.

Since neither of us are experts in the field of hand reconstruction, we don't know if the swelling in his hand is normal or if it is the first stage of CRPS which Nanci suffers from. We also do not know if his flap is looking good or not, and exactly what a good looking flap should look like. I am sure that part of this is our stressing over the fact that the first one failed, and our fear over what happens if this one does.

It is also frustrating seeing Ian wishing that he could be any place except where he is rigth now, in the hospital, no matter how good this one is. He will have nearly missed a month of school, when he can return is unknown, and he may wind up missing the balance of the semester and having to complete his sophomore year during the summer. He was especially bummed when we had to make the decision to cancel our family vacation in April, but there just will be no way that he is going to be ready by then.

Every one of these complaints has a very short "yes, but" answer. Yes, but Ian is still here. Yes, but we are getting the best of care. Yes, but there is an end in sight and a year from now Ian will likely be nearly as if this never happened. Yes, but stop your whining since do you know how many kids, families, people deal with so many things FAR more difficult than what your family is going through?

I know this stuff in my head and in my heart. Yes, but right now I want to complain, and I am already feelling a little bit better for doing so.

You see, the sucky part is where Nanci and Ian and I "suck it up" and deal with it. There is no going back. There is only going forward. Who cares if it has been a month, because Ian is better than he was just a little bit ago. I guess it is OK to be sad, to be tired, to be frustrated, to be lost and out of control and not sure what happens next, and to be just a wee bit impatient. These things, while normal, are not going to help Ian get better, and so I will suck it up and go do something fun. Like my income taxes.

And I will say a prayer for continued strength since there is absolutely no way Nanci and I can do it without God's help, and all of your prayers as well.

The Others...

No, I am not speaking about Lost. Although, this season has been pretty wild so far. I am actually commenting on some of the other children at Shriners who I have mentioned before in my blogs.

Tonight was bingo night. Five or six kids participated, including an unwilling Ian. Josh, who a few weeks ago was in critical condition came down and is making some remarkable progress. It was good to see his mom looking better as well, as she was having sleep difficulty about a week ago.

Ali, from Iraq, was there with his grandmother. She speaks no english, and Ali is just starting to learn it. He is about ten years old, and actively participated in spinning the bingo machine. And I mean actively. Sometimes a ball would go flying across the room and he would giggle "sorry" as he went to retrieve it. 

Man-Man, who is about three, came to play with his mother. I passed them my card which just happened to have a Bingo on it. He selected a Hot Wheels car from the prize bucket, and after winning two more games over the evening, had quite a fleet of toy cars. 

Each of these children has made remarkable progress, although they are likely to still be in the hospital for a lot longer than Ian will be in order to continue getting skin grafts. Did you know that the back of the head is one of the best places for skin grafts to come from? I didn't before we started visiting shriners.

All of the kids respond so well to a smile, and a hello, even those who do not speak english well. Miguel is no longer a resident as he is staying with a foster family, but he certainly would flash Ian a big grin and a thumbs up every time he saw Ian. I tried out my Spanish from time to time and I am sure that my words did not make much sense but he seemed to appreciate the effort.

The bingo game was run tonight by two young men in high school. It says something about their character for them to give up part of their Saturday night to spend playing bingo with a bunch of kids in the hospital. Kudos guys. I wish I had gotten your names so I could thank you personally in this journal entry.

Now that Ian has gotten out of bed a few times, his morale has improved significantly. I expect him to sleep well tonight after all of the exertion. We also found a wheeled reclining bed/chair that we used when Ian gave a tour of the hospital to a friend's parents who stopped by this afternoon. Ian even got outside for a few minutes on the rooftop patio garden.

All in all, it was a beautiful day with lots of small steps forward for both Ian and many of the other kids at the hospital. I hope it is a quiet night for the nurses with no new patients coming in.

Good night.

Jeff

Happy Saturday.

Ian just finished his first walk since Tuesday. The nurses and doctors changed his bandages, removed the tight ace around his middle replacing it with a reminder ace, and told him to take a stroll. Ian made it fifteen feet to the nurses station and back, complaining the whole entire way. I guess he has something to complain about, since he has not been out of bed for three full days. This makes me believe that the seen in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory where Grandpa Joe dances around right after getting out of bed is total make believe. What does that say about the rest of the movie?

The important part of today's bandage change was looking at his thumb flap. Both Nanci and I held our breath, but once the bandages were removed, everything looked the pale normal color of the rest of Ian's skin. This was a huge relief. And, while we try to remain cautiously optimistic knowing that there are still many days ahead, had it been the purple color it was before, I think that Nanci and I would have collapsed into a disappointed quivering mass of tears (outside of the room of course).

To understand how weak Ian is right now, flash back to any film clip of a new young fawn trying to stand on her own. Of course, Ian's mouth is not weak, and he was using it to tell us of his displeasure with our requiring that he get up and walk. I have heard somewhere that Ian will need about a week of recovery for every day in the hospital, and it is looking like that is already up to about six months. I may try to figure out how to hook up a PC to a treadmill where Ian has to walk to power his computer. All other helpful ideas and suggestions are welcome.

I am going to return to Ian's room now to assist him getting back to bed. He has a request for the Austin Powers DVD of Goldmember. Anybody have a copy we can borrow? If so, drop me an email. As far as visitors go, I can't promise you that Ian will be much fun, or even awake, but I am sure that some smiling faces other than Mom and Dad would be appreciated today and tomorrow.

Two Down...(quick updates)

Ian's mood has definitely improved. Smiles do appear on his face from time to time, he has been reading his RFID Cool Toys book, and he has started to eat...a little.

Ian's former neighbor on the third floor, Gabbi, will be his new neighbor on the second floor. This is excellent news as it means that she is getting better. The second floor is for those patients who are no longer acute and don't need constant one on one care. When children return to Shriners for additional surgery, such as skin grafts, they often stay on the second floor.

Tammy, Chau's daughter, is much more lucid than she has been. Nanci was able to read her a story last night. 

Gotta run so I can get a shower before work.

The Five Fs

Faith, Family, Friends, Fitness, Fiscal

I wanted to spend a few minutes sharing with the readers of Ian's journal something a good friend of mine shared with me a few years ago. We were discussing the concept of balance, and he offered the above five fs as a way to keep focused (a sixth f?) on what is important in life. I know that the order is also significant, and I believe that I have remembered them in the proper order, but I will issue a correction if not.

The first F, for faith, is simply that one needs to remember that the Lord is the lord of all. The Maker of Everything should not take a back seat to the other areas in your life, but, if you are like me, often times does. Isn't it funny how in times of stress this first F seems to rise to the top? Just ask any student who has not prepared well enough for a test.

The second F is for family. Family truly matters, both those you care about and those that care for you as well. This F is very easy to take "for granted".

The third F, for friends, really have blown Nanci and I away. While I sound like a broken record, we have been amazed by all of the offers for assistance, the meals, the notes, the cards, the prayers, the emails, the things that you are doing for others that have absolutely nothing to do with us, the hugs that you are giving those that you love, and so forth. Keep it up, even way, way after Ian is better and back at taking things apart.

Fitness, or the fourth F, is currently off my list. I will get around to it. I promise. I can't wait to ride my bike now that the weather is warm, and I am sure that Pete is dying for Ian, Nanci and I to take him for a walk around the neighborhood as soon as we can. Without Fitness, it is hard to have the energy to give the other Fs the attention that they deserver

Fifth F. Fiscal. Isn't this the one that usually arrives at the top of the list for nearly everybody? Yes, money is important, but when push comes to shove, it usually falls pretty quickly to the bottom of the list. How many times have you thought "I would give (pay) anything to have one more day, one more chance, one more minute with that person that I love who is no longer with us..." Well, what are you doing about the minutes that you have with the ones who are here today? Are you leaving the office a minute early to be able to spend that priceless time with them? Just a thought.

For all of Ian's friends in school who are reading this blog, let me share with you (soap box time) one minute's worth of an idea. As you are thinking about what you want to do with the rest of your life, where you want to go to school, and what you want to study, remember one thing. You will be spending YEARS working at whatever it is you choose to do, so make sure that you love it. If you have passion, if it truly excites you, then you really don't wind up working at all. Instead, you do what you love, and surprisingly, the money will follow. It is much harder to be happy if all you are after is the money. Trust me on this. My clients have taught me this in spades. 

Now, on to Ian. Ian has spent most of the day sleeping. We were able to get him glasses, so I no longer have to put in and take out his contacts each day. He still isn't overly comfortable, but nor is he overly crabby.

Some friends of mine at the National Association of Personal Financial Advisors made Ian's day when a box of Amazon.com books arrived. Included are RFID Hacks, a book on string theory, and a book on wikinomics and one more that escapes me right now. (I need a nap) How cool is all of this?! Also thanks to my friend out east who sent Ian a book on the history of the atomic bomb. Hmm, while I am at it, thanks to all of those who have made a donation to caringbridge, or to Shriners, or who have closed their eyes and said a prayer for Ian or anybody, including just being thankful for what they have themselves. And thanks to Tim for telling me about the five Fs.

Blessings!

One down, two to go.

Ian's night was a bit rough. Pretty much everything hurt, from his hair to his toenails. We changed his pain medicines about 1 am back to the tried and true Tylox, and this allowed him to get a few hours of rest.

On one level, I know that Ian understands what he needs to do to give the procedure the best chance of working. On another level, Ian is still a bit disappointed with the couple of steps backwards. I can't blame him at all, but this has not been the time for discussion. I have had to be much more firm with Ian yesterday and today and pretty much tell him what he is going to do, no discussion, no debate. I can do this since it is only for a couple more days.

Temporary Update...Revised 5:53 PM  </time>

Ian's surgery took about an hour and a half. There was continued damage to the muscle formerly known as good on his thumb under the groin flap. This is what is known as creeping necrosis in electrical burn speak. It appears that damage continues for a while afterwards when in fact it simply takes a while for the damage to actually show itself.

In Nanci's words to me, the doctor does believe that this groin flap will take better, but Ian is to be confined to bed for a few days to give the maximum chance for the microscopic blood vessels to heal. This is really ticking him off. He has pressure boots (they look like nylon bags for snow skis) on his feet to keep his blood pressure up and flowing towards the flap. Understandably, his hand hurts where they cleaned it up and reattached it to the flap. The IV is third on Ian's hate list, and fortunately the number one despised catheter (ha, pun intended) and number two loathed drains are not visiting him this time.

The thought of Ian being bound for the next few days is enough to set him off into tears. I can't tell him anything different, and if this is what the docs are suggesting this time, then we need to give it a try. I believe that the groin flap is the best of all of the other alternatives, so doing all that we can to encourage the blood flow is our goal.

I would not let Ian tell me that he was not hungry, athough only a few things sound good to him right now. They are Chicken Ramen Noodles, Skittles, Sorbet and unsweetened Iced Tea. I may be driving around trying to find the sorbet as while the food here is pretty good, I don't think that they have sorbet on the menu.

We don't know when Ian may be coming home this time, but it may be sometime this weekend. It is hard for me to see the kid who was smiling and dealing well with his attached hand is such misery right now. He barely even smiled when I showed him the "Hacking Roomba" book I purchased for him from Amazon. Ian has been bugging me since we got Scuttle the Roomba to be able to improve on her...

I have to get back to his room...I will continue to update this one Journal entry tonight as I know more.

Please pray for just this, that Ian's hand has blood flow from the hand to the thumb, instead of just from the flap to the damaged thumb.

*Contrast*

Just when I think I can't take it any more, all I have to do is visit my friends in the Acute Care unit to know I can hang on. I finally got to see the face of the sweetest little angel...Tammy, one of our out of state friends. She asked me to wash my hands and sit by her side for a moment. She asked me to rub one of her arms, which are both covered by ace bandages so that they are rigid and straight. Then, when I left, she shook my hand. The grace of that little lady just about brought me to a puddle right there.

Then I went upstairs to be with Ian for the evening. We had mostly a light-hearted evening of watching "How It's Made" and "Dirty Jobs", with a few profound words in between like "I can think of places I'd rather be tonight." We prayed, and he slept well...I think.

He went back to surgery at exactly 7:30; Jeff or I will post an update when we have the time, likely later this evening. I am tired and want to stay with him and Jeff has an appointment this morning and should be here to relieve me later this afternoon.

Curveball

Ian returned to Shriners Hospital this afternoon, and will be having an additonal surgery tomorrow morning, Wednesday, at 7:30 AM to attempt to redo part of his groin flap. Here is what has happened.

With a flap, it is often normal for the end where it is attached to his hand to get "stressed". The flap uses an artery from the groin area to get blood to it and to the thumb. Sometimes, there is stress near the end of the flap and it does not get enough blood. If this happens, the tissue can die. We knew that Ian had a stressed area, but it did not recover over the last few days.

Fortunately, it appears that the rest of Ian's flap is healthy enough to attempt a repeat of the surgery he had 11 days ago. Rather than having to create a new flap, the dead portion will be removed and the healthy portion will be reattached. His hand will wind up being just a bit closer to his side. Ian will likely remain at Shriners until the weekend as they will want to watch things to make sure that this surgery succeeds better. He will want to have visitors, but probably not on Wednesday since he will still be groggy from surgery.

It should then take about the same two weeks for the tissue to connect to the thumb bone. After this happens, another outpatient surgery will be done which cuts the main blood vessel from the groin flap which, if all goes well, should encourage the skin and tissue to get nutrients from the thumb itself instead of nearly 90% from the groin area. If this works, then after another week, Ian's left hand will be parted from his side and will be allowed to heal before any future corrective surgeries are done.

We have known from the beginning that there is the possibility that this procedure will not work. With medicine and the human body, there is always risk of things not proceeding down the path that one hopes. Nanci and I are still optimistic, but are also feeling a bit whipsawed. Of course, Ian feels the most discouragement right now.

There is still lots of good news, and other things that can be done, if this type of surgery does not work out. I guess, ironically, that my post this morning about not worrying about crossing bridges until I come to them is something that I needed to remind myself about just for the circumstances that popped up this afternoon.

As usual, in the infamous words of Bartles and James, Thank you for your support! I could use a wine cooler about now.

Someday Isle

There are times when I listen to softly spoken words, and then there are other times when I need a two by four upside the head in order to change. The whole Ian situation has a little bit of both for me.

The biggest issue that I have spent most of my life working towards achieving is "balance." You know, the nirvana of working the right amount, spending time with loved ones, eating and exercising, staying healthy, time for God, and everything going along swimmingly. The challenge is that I suck at balance. Every time I feel that I am getting something in good control, two other areas of my life are out of control. Nearly all of the areas that are out of control are self imposed as well. Like a few days ago, with a cookie in my mouth, I was complaining to nobody in particular about wishing that I had not gained as many pounds as I have since I stopped biking. Megan, who was standing nearby me, said, "the YMCA is open dad." Zing. The arrow hit its mark.

What has been particularly interesting (the only word that I can describe it right now) about Ian's injury is how it has caused me to shift my focus a bit. As a financial planner, certified even, I earn my living helping others to clarify what is important to them, and then assisting them to align their resources to move towards achieving those goals. Most of them are longer term, hence the pun in the title Someday I Will...

All I have been able to think about these last few days is how easy it is to miss life waiting for the someday I will do this or that. But what about the short term, about the next 12 hours? For me it has been easier worrying about tomorrow instead of taking care of the things that I can do something about, which is how I choose to use my time today. My head knows that this is backwards, but it has been so difficult to make this shift.

Today we should hear when Ian's surgery is scheduled. He really has been sleeping better now that he is off the Ambien. Each day, his grafts seem to be getting a bit better. There is only one spot that "worries" Nanci and I and that is where is thumb is sewn into the end of the pouch. It has never been the same color as the rest of his skin, and continues to be dark and discolored with areas of red. The doctor was not concerned, but we are, only because we have not been here before and don't know what the road looks like ahead. I am trying with all of my ability to let go and let God as the saying goes, without being silly and ignoring what is right in front of me. I find it is easier to lose weight than it is to do this...

Thanks for your continued prayers and support.

Jeff

Slow and Steady

Ian has been continuing to heal. Each time we change his dressing, it hurts a little bit less. Either that, or he is getting use to the pain, but I doubt it.

Nanci and I are getting a first hand glimpse of how hard it is to be a nurse. We both are comfortable doing the bandage changes and the therapy. Now it is simply the amount of time it takes, and all of the associated laundry, cleaning and so forth.

Ian has some friends coming over to visit today. His school is on Spring Break, so he won't get any more behind during this week. Yesterday, Ian mentioned that he really hopes that the house could be picked up since he will have visitors. Nanci and I just looked at him. Neither of us said the first ten or fifteen things that came to our mind as they were not polite. Instead, I just said "we will see what we can do."

I attempted to do too much yesterday...I just wanted to have a normal day. Nanci and I went to church, made a purchase for Ian's new bedroom, Megan and I went shopping, and then we cleaned the kitchen, cooked dinner and did a little yardwork. I was simply trying to pretend that I was returning from vacation and needed to catch up. It did not work. I wound up wiping myself out and needed several cups of coffee to get myself up and running this AM.

In case anyone is still thinking about helping Chau and Tammy and Jennifer and Josh at Shriner's, let me give you a brief up date. Chau does not eat seafood or beef; she is a chicken and pork person only. I have put together a small care package of soaps, creams and shampoos and will be taking them to Shriners in the next day or so. Both women are going to be here in Cincinnati for quite a while. I have not found out about any of their hobbies yet; they are pretty much 100% focused on their children right now. I know that they are going to need a break and I plan on trying to get them out for a small amount of time the next sunny day.

Also, in case you may have wondered why no update yesterday, our internet went down.

TTFN,

Jeff

It depends on who you ask...

I have now changed Ian's dressings three times. Either the pain pills are getting stronger, Ian's hand is getting better, or I am improving as I go along. Probably a bit of all three.

Ian's mood has dramatically improved since arriving at home. I think seeing his "own" place, his pets, and his family have had a significant impact on his state of mind.

Ian's appetite has also returned with a vengance. I suppose that I was worried over nothing, as in the last thirty six hours he has started asking for food even before we ask him...and that is a good thing as it was becoming a point of contention between us. Thank you everyone who contacted us and pretty much told us that this would happen. I guess you have had to have been here before...

Sean has taken an interest in holding Ian's good hand during his therapy so that Ian has something to squeeze when it hurts. I am glad to see this and I hope it will help Sean's concern over whether Ian's hand would be OK or not. He has had a hard time letting go of the initial vision of Ian's burned hand and now he can see how much better it looks. It is still pretty ugly, but most of the damage is on the palm side which is kept out of sight due to Ian's thumb being attached.

Another encouraging sign is that Ian has been able to move his thumb within the pouch.

Today has been an emotional day. It started with several of the mom's discussing how hard it was being helpless while their children have to deal with their bandages being changed, and the fact that their loved ones are not out of the woods yet. I could not do much but listen, and let them know that Nanci and I are glad to assist in any way that we can. Please remember to pray for Tammy and Josh and Gabbi and especially their moms. 

When we left the hospital about 12:30, I was actually a bit sad. It was not possible to say goodbye in person to all of Ian's wonderful nurses, and we just kind of walked out the door when we were ready to go. Definitely different from how Ian went in...

Sean is going to sleep downstairs with Ian to make sure that he is there if Ian needs anything. The cats are also keeping Ian company. I hope that Nanci and I will collapse and have the first sound sleep we have had knowing that we both can be there if Ian needs anything, but I doubt he will. He has been sleeping pretty well.

Pleasant dreams and a good night to everyone!

Ian's Home! 


#### <time> Friday, March 16, 2007 6:53 PM </time>

Healing at Home...

Ian is relocating to his home for continued recovery as of St. Patrick's day. I don't know for sure what time we will leave the hospital, but I would suspect that he will be home by early afternoon. 

Visitors are welcome of course...please feel free to email Nanci at [we_teachem@yahoo.com][4] or Jeff at [jdaniher@zoomtown.com][5] with an idea of when you might want to stop by. If you include your phone number, we can call you back as well as reply via email since it might be a little while between when you send it and when we can check it. Just remember, we have five "fierce" cats and one terrifying poodle dog who will welcome you with a kiss.

Quality, not Quantity

I have heard from many, many people that this journal has been a great way to communicate how Ian is doing. I want people to know that I most certainly plan on continuing to post entries on a regular basis. I think that the frequency of the postings is likely to decrease a bit as I want to be certain that I have news of Ian that is of interest. As a reader, I would be bored with "Ian ate a banana for breakfast, slept this afternoon, and watched some TV" or something like that.

The good news is that Ian appears to be making remarkable progress. There is some minor concern about the color of the flap where it is sewn to his hand. The doctors say that while this is not unexpected, it is not what they want either. It indicates that there are some circulation challenges in this area. Yet, if they were overly concerned, I believe that they would have told us and most likely would not be sending Ian home to continue healing.

We know that there are going to be several, perhaps multiple more surgeries in Ian's near future. Next week there will be a quick one where the flap will be partially severed which will allow Ian more time to heal. Then, there will be a more in depth surgery where the flap will be completely severed and his hand will be free. After this, reconstruction of the thumb will continue, but we don't yet have a good idea as to how long it might be between different surgeries. Eventually, a part of a toe will be placed on the left thumb to facilitate sensation.

So, as you can see, the adventures of the electric kid will continue for sometime. I am sure that there will also be some more soap box entries as well as pleas for prayers. 

It has been my goal to be completely transparent in my journaling about Ian. While it is my wish that nobody else will ever experience something like this, perhaps, if they do, they may have a bit of preparation through some of the things that Nanci and I have shared. Personally, I have been tremendously benefited from the process of writing these entries as well as the communication from many of you. I can't thank you all enough. 

One final comment for this morning. I will do my best to put up more pictures. I am limited to twelve at any one time, but will do my best to show Ian as he is. I won't post any of the graphic pictures of the injury, but I do have them in case they would be of benefit to anyone. (I would find them totally fascinating if it was not that they were of my son.) I have also posted one link about electrical injuries under the link section, and will be adding more from time to time as I come across them.

Until next time,

Jeff

The Hardest Part for Me

is the fact that I will soon be responsible for changing Ian's bandages and assisting him with performing his therapy. The wounds themselves do not bother me, as I have seen far worse on him and on others. What scares me is the thought of being responsible for his physical therapy. Other than losing a child, I think the hardest thing for a parent is seeing their child in pain, *especially* when they are contributing to it.

I know in my heart that the hand therapy is necessary and good for him in the long run. But, when it makes Ian yell out in pain, and causes tears to well in his eyes and then stream down his cheeks, it just tears Nanci and I up. Today, when I was there learning how to assist him with his therapy, I wanted to cry.

Encouraging him to eat is easy. Nagging him to walk down and around the nurse's station is simple. Right now, even gently bending his fingers and holding them in the proper position brings forth involuntary yells and gasps from deep inside Ian. It breaks my heart. I know it needs to be done. But all I want to do is wake up from this part of the bad dream.

In addition to praying for Ian's continued recover, please pray especially for Nanci and I that we be gentle as possible, but firm enough to do what needs to be done as often as it needs to be done, even though we do not want to do it.

Thank you for caring.

Jeff

Hey all...  

 Thanks for your continued care and support.  

 Important pieces of information:  

* Drains come out tomorrow.  
* Tomorrow my donor site for the grafts is scrubbed, and thankfully I get ketamine(sp), a sedative.  
* I get to return home Saturday, facilitating many visits over spring break.  

...and...  

* Today was by far my most active day and I wore myself out again and again.  

 I miss you all, and sorry for the short entry,  

 Ian--

Two Weeks...

It is hard to believe, but two weeks ago this morning, Ian arrived at Shriners.

Anyway, Ian got a solid night's sleep last night, and so did his dad. Unlike the first few nights that he was here where they were monitoring him every hour on the hour, the nurses only need to check on him periodically. This is a good sign that he is getting closer to coming home.

Another GREAT sign that Ian will be able to come home soon to continue his healing is that right after I finished last night's entry, Ian got up out of bed, almost completely by himself and then decided that he would make a lap around the nurses station. I taped the back of his gown shut so that the moon did not blind anyone, and Ian wobbled around the hallway with me at his side. He flashed a big smile to all of the nurses. Even though he was a bit unsteady on his feet, he was proud to have gotten out of bed, on his own.

Have a great day!

Jeff

Mostly more of the same...

Not much new to report on the Ian front. Munching on a few things here or there...he really seems to like pears and apples which is not all bad. 

Today he has been able to turn the pages of his Wired Magazine one handed. He spent a lot of time reading it while I attended a caregiver session and was really glad that I did. Everyone there had one thing in common and that was burn accidents happen suddenly, with no warning, and instantly turn your world upside down. This, and that there is unanimous agreement that Shriners' nurses are really angels working among us.

Nanci and I will keep people posted as to when Ian may be going home. It depends on when the drains are able to come out of his incision in his side, and how well he is able to be mobile. Ian will have a bed in our living room and today four of our cats had decided that it was a pretty good perch for watching the birds. I am sure that we will have to decide on some visiting hours at our house, but I know that Ian would certainly want to have people stop by and see him. One word of warning is that we have friendly pets and lots of them: a dog who thinks that every time someone comes to the door that they are there to see him, five cats, although you will likely only see four, and a guinea pig who likes to perform duets with the dog.

Hmm, our house will be like visiting the zoo and a hospital all at the same time!

Coming Home Saturday?

Ian had the grafts on his left hand examined today. Let's just say that it hurt a lot. The docs want him to go home ASAP, and if he gets knocked out with pain medicines, it delays his ability to go home by another day, so, in Ian's words, the bandage change was not exactly comfortable today. It is hoped that the two drains can be removed tomorrow as well.

I plan on posting more this evening after I have had a chance to speak with Ian and see how his hand is doing.

Separation Anxiety

*Warning. Sentence fragments ahead…*

Tuesday evening. Late. For me at least, since I am still pretty dog tired (where did that saying come from anyway?) and getting a bit discouraged and I think now the hard part is setting in.

Ian still has very little appetite. This is bothersome to Nanci and I, as his body is in hyper mode burning 3000+ calories a day trying to heal. We have responded to his requests for what appeals to him, but by the time they arrive, he just isn't overly hungry. This may be normal, but it is hard looking at an already skinny kid get even a bit skinnier. Since he has not been up and around much for the last few days, his muscle tone has also decreased. What this says to me is that he will have a good bit of physical therapy ahead to recover from what, as a percentage, is a pretty small injury. Maybe I can figure out a way to dangle his computer in front of him like a carrot in front of a horse…

As to me, I have been having an especially difficult time the last few days missing my son. You see, I got to spend nearly ten very long days hanging with my teenager. Not many dads are lucky enough to get to do that. While I wish we could have done it without him being in a great deal of pain, and without the hand disfigurement, I still enjoyed the chance to see what type of person my teenage son is growing up to be.

I am proud of Ian. Of his faith. Of his strength. Of the ways that he looks at things. Of his caring and concern for others even while he is in a difficult situation himself. Of the areas where he has learned things on his own that I know nothing about. I believe in my heart that he has a terrific future ahead of him, adn that this experience will shape what he wants to be when he grows up. I know that he needs a mentor who can speak science with him as I cannot keep up with him anymore.  He knows so much more than I do in so many different areas that I wish I could go back to school to catch up.

So, I miss him. I know that Nanci is doing a great job of being there for him. A couple of days ago she accused me, gently, of being selfish. Of my not letting her get to care for, and nurture, her son. I never thought of it that way, but I can see her point. Most men don't get the opportunity to do what I got to do, and I must thank John, Ronda, Debbie and our wonderful clients for allowing it to happen. For the gift that I was given in spite of all that has happened.

Ian may be able to come home soon and continue his recovery in his own house. I hope that this can happen, but in the meantime, we need to figure out a way to get him to eat and how to get him up and around and using his muscles. Any ideas? 

Thanks for listening. And thanks for your continued prayers and all other kinds of support.

Jeff

Ian was up and alert most of the day. Grandma and Grandpa were here until late afternoon, when Dad came by to visit after work. Mom ran around to do errands and keep the home fires burning.

Ian even sat in a chair today. About 20 minutes was all he could stand. I was really proud of him that he did it, even though it was the last thing on his "wanna do" list. He is also trying to eat beyond what he is hungry for. They want the kids in here to eat around 3000 calories a day, to rebuild tissue. That is really hard when everything tastes bad to you, and meds make your stomach churn. So a boneless chicken breast was quite a good dinner, and there were other things.

It really stinks to adapt to having something sewn into one's abdomen, but I know Ian will be OK. I just doubt this will be remembered as the most fun month of his life.

My heart continues to break for other parents here at the hospital. Does anyone know of a Vietnamese family in the Cinci area? There is a young woman here with her child - they live out of state - and they have strong ties with the (mom's) Vietnamese culture. "Home cooking" has a different meaning to my new friend, and she will likely be here for a long time. Her mom and son died in the fire that severely injured her daughter.

Please send some prayers her way. Love and thanks to all...Nanci

Another good night's sleep. Ian had many visitors yesterday, including some Latin School friends, CHCA friends, and Mr. Walker, CHCA Assistant Principal. This morning, I received a phone call from the orthodontist's office, asking what they can do to help. I continue to be overwhelmed by the support we have received from friends and family! 

Ian's Grandma Kit and Grandpa Frank kept him company today while I ran errands, including an emergency dental visit for Sean.

Dr. Yakuboff stopped in to peek at the progress early this morning, and was pleased. Ian was to get up and walk around today...when I return to the hospital, I will find out how that went.

We are still working on pain management. Ian is still trying to adjust to a brand new routine.

Thanks to all of you for your continued notes of encouragement. It is impossible to express our gratitude in words.

Ian had a good night's sleep. He had some PopTarts and a smoothie. The other good news is that the IV is gone! Now comes the harder part of getting up and around. Not looking forward to that, but it's the plan for the day.

Grandparents are back this morning, and we expect other visitors, so that is something to look forward to. 

We continue to pray for the others here. I've got to run now, but will post this evening.

*Shift Change*

Ian's Dad is now at the Miami U swim meet, and his Mom is now a guest here at Shriner's for the night.

That bothersome ace bandage was removed today, and Ian has lost some of his stiffness. The IV meds were removed, and Ian now gets a pain pill (or two) every several hours. Tomorrow he hopes to get "unhooked" from everything and get up a bit. Everything still hurts, but we hope for better things each day.

Ian got a visit from his (Florida) Grandma Kit and Grandpa Frank. He also got surprise visitors from Alliance...Grandma and Grandpa Fig came down with Uncle Bill and Aunt Sandi. Ian got a great big grin on his face when he saw everyone. Brother, Sean, came with everyone and helped get Ian some good snacks.

Family comes back for more visits tomorrow. At the end of swim championships this weekend, we have a two week break from swim practice...and everyone gets a break from school classes for one of those weeks! This will give us needed time to get our house transformed from a construction site to a functioning home! We had been working on some remodeling projects before all this happened.

Ian hopes to take the Ohio Graduation Test here at Shriner's, to get that checked off of his list. We'll see next week how that might work.

We have to go to sleep...I'll post in the morning after visitors.

Getting Evicted... :)

Jeff is going home, sort of, via the swim meet in Oxford. I promised my family that I would let them know whenever it was that I reached the end of my ability to function due to stress and sleep deprivation. It looks like I was able to make it about ten days.

I did get a much better night's sleep last night. Since Ian has been in so much pain, they have been keeping him pretty well medicated. This allowed me to crash about 9 pm and I got out of bed this morning at 7 am. I would love to say that I got ten solid hours of sleep, but the truth is that since the kids here get such great care, I was awake multiple times during the night. The only thing that I have in my experience to compare it to is having a newborn. I have not had that type of sleep in, oh, about a decade. 

Before last night's rest, I could feel that I was nearing the point anyway that I would need to go home. There would be random times in my sentences where words would not come. The bed seemed to be calling to me on a regular basis. I would have a noticable lift from a diet cherry coke, but unlike normally where one cup of caffiene would keep me awake for hours past my bedtime staring at the ceiling, there was no such impact here.

In a way, I think I could understand how Ian must have felt physically the week or so before is accident. Too much to do to get the sleep that his body needed, which I am sure contributed in a small way to him getting the rest that he needs here at Shriners.

Soapbox alert!

For all of Ian's friends who are reading this, let me toss out an idea for you. Get some sleep! Your body needs it. Sleep is good for you and likely contrary to what you think, you won't die if you don't IM all of your friends or catch up on your facebook or myspace page. Bawls or Vault or Starbucks may keep you going. What your body wants and needs, however, is rest. So, go to bed! End of lecture...

Now on to Ian. Not much of a change to report for the last 20 hours. Ian is still sedated pretty heavily. He does not like the ace bandage wrapped around his torso which is there to keep his left arm in place. It will come off in a day or so. Right now, it is designed to keep his hand still.

Ian has more tubes in him than before, which I know he just loves. Since he is confined to bed for the first period of time after surgery, he has both an IV, wound drainage tubes, and a catheter. The only good thing about the IV is that it allows the morphine to be added quickly. About the wound drainage tubes Ian commented "I did not need to see that..."

Finally, I did have my chance to get a cry in yesterday. It came at me really hard when I was waiting for Ian to come out of recovery after surgery. Nanci and I had just gotten the positive news that the surgery went well and while there would still be more down the road, the outlook was great. I walked back to his room, and he was not there yet. The empty room, sans Ian in his bed, really hit me hard. We could have lost him. We could be mourning the Ian that was rather than dealing with the Ian that is, and looking forward to the Ian that will be.

Hug those you love, and perhaps even those you don't like so much right now.

Can you be your own Siamese Twin?

Ian is out of surgery and is in the recovery room. I have so much info to share that I will do my best to make sure that I get it all in and don't mix things up. Before I do, first things first. Thank you, everyone, who has been praying for Ian. Thank you Lord for watching over Ian and his caregivers.

Ian has four areas on his left hand where he has received skin grafts; they are on the back of his hand, between his first two fingers, and two on his palm.

Ian's thumb has the temporary pin in it to hold it in place while it heals. The pin will come out sometime in the future. Dr. Yakuboff also was able to repair some of Ian's ligament to the lower thumb joint.

And, now, to the important part. Dr. Y indicated that he felt the groin flap went very well. Ian's thumb is encased in a living skin tube of himself so that his thumb bone will get blood and nutrients and this will allow a regrowth of muscle and tissue to replace what he burned. The success rate for this type of surgery is around 80% which is very high.

Ian's thumb will be attached for two to three weeks, depending on how fast he is healing. Somewhere during this time, the skin flap will be partially separated which will allow for it to partially heal which increases the success rate. This will be a very short surgery. The full division will require a longer procedure, more in line with the last few.

For the next day or two, Ian will be confined to bed and will be gently bound so that he does not unknowingly pull his hand away. After this time, the doctor indicated that most kids do really well and will have the ability to move his arm a bit. This is good news as Ian's biggest concern has been how will heI be able to sleep and move around with his hand attached to his body.

One of the reasons that this type of surgery was chosen was that it allows for excellent blood supply. There are many other flaps that could have been used, but this one has the best results for reconstruction of the thumb.

While the future time frame is still not known, and a lot will deal with how quickly he heals, somewhere during the next weeks to months, Ian will be a candidate for a toe cap transfer. This means that he will not have to lose a toe; instead, they take the cap of tissue around the toe, including the nail, and microsurgially attach it to his thumb. If all goes well, the nerves will regrow and this will give Ian the sensation necessary to have a functional hand. All I can say is wow. 

Jeff


#### <time> Friday, March 9, 2007 9:54 AM </time>

Ian went back to surgery about 9 am. The docs said it would be around a two hour surgery to place grafts, do the groin flap, and pin his thumb to keep everything in place.

Everyone slept pretty well last night. Ian has been getting Ambien, and then this morning they gave him some "good" meds to prepare him for surgery. So, this morning he barely reached consciousness. It was all good. He was peaceful, but hungry.

Our friend (and right-hand man), Tamara, brought Panera bagels for the surgery waiting room. We ran into the Parent Night coordinator, and she told Jeff that...at his suggestion...there will be chicken wings at the next parent night. No luck on the beer to go with them, though! Any little bit of "normalcy" that can be achieved in here is appreciated.

We'll update later, after we talk to the doc.

Early to bed, early to rise...

As one would expect, Ian has spent most of the day sleeping. He rated his pain level a six today, which is the highest it has been since the first few days of the accident. I am not surprised that his hand really hurts. The surgeons removed the donor skin covering, prepared his hand for tomorrow's skin grafts, and likely flexed and checked out the working of his fingers. My hand hurts just thinking about it. Fortunately, Ian has the benefit of morphine to ease his pain and help him sleep.

Ian's face broke into a big grin when I told him that they are trying to keep as much of him in place as they can. Later in the day, however, he has been struggling a bit to keep on smiling. Besides the pain, he hates his IV since it interferes with him getting comfortable and his left hand has been bleeding a bit through the wet bandage which he finds discouraging. 

So, today is a day for Ian to sleep and get ready for tomorrow. The surgery is supposed to begin about 9:30 am. I will share with you what we learn from his doctors once Nanci and I have a chance to speak with them after his surgery. I am not sure how long it will take, but I expect that the procedures (the groin flap and the skin grafting) will take a bit longer than his previous operations.

Good luck to Megan Daniher tomorrow as she swims in the YMCA AA championships in Oxford, Ohio. Nanci will be with her on Friday night and I will be there on Saturday night.

I believe in the power of prayer.

Due to a last minute emergency surgery that called away Dr. Bailey, Ian was moved up to 8:00 this morning. Of course, expecting that he was scheduled for a couple of hours later, we were both sawing logs. Or at least Ian says that I was snoring pretty well last night...

Dr. Yakuboff performed Ian's surgery today, and will also be doing it tomorrow. *To be to the point, things were better than expected.* If my directness of discussing Ian's hand bothers you, feel free to skip over the next few paragraphs.

The first thing that Dr. Y did was to remove the dead tissue and nail on Ian's left thumb. The bone, however, was still alive, so he left it entirely in place. Ian will not lose his thumb, but he will definitely still require reconstructive surgery to the thumb, including moving part of a toe, or less likely, a finger, so that he will have feeling in the rebuilt thumb. Ian will have this thumb sewn into a flap of skin near his left groin tomorrow. He will have a pin put into his thumb where he damaged it near the second joint. Right now, there is not much holding his thumb and without the pin, the thumb could fall off. Dr. Y mentioned that he has some nerves and parts of tendons to work with, as well as the muscle at the base of the thumb, so that this will give him the most number of options at this time. Those were the words that warmed my heart. Options. Possibilities. Great words.

Ian will need to have skin grafts on his hand as well, on the back, in between some fingers and on parts of the palm. The groin flap will reduce the amount of skin that will need to be grafted as this will serve as the living tissue wrapping around his left thumb bone once it heals. More good news. Ian will not need to have skin grafts on any of his other burns. They all appear to be healing well.

Ian will lose a few milimeters off the end of the left middle finger, and likely the nail, as this part was very badly burned when the electricity left his body. But, Dr. Y believes that he won't have to remove it, but that it will separate by itself and his finger will continue to heal. As I mentioned yesterday, Ian has nearly full movement already in his right hand, which is his dominant hand. As it continues to heal, we will learn what types of therapy he will need to do.

Continue reading here if you want the just the quick summary:

Ian's thumb is in better shape than was previously thought which leaves Dr. Yakuboff more options to repair things.

Ian will have a more extended surgery tomorrow morning, likely about 9:30.

Now, is this a miracle? In my opinion, no and yes. No, it is not a miracle in the biblical sense were someone "magically" was brought back to life or healed without any intervention. Most definitely YES in the way that everything has fallen into place, the way that the right caregivers were available at the right times, the way that Ian's left hand is better than expected.

I believe we have all heard the parable about the man who was in a flood and passed on the boat and the helicopter while he was waiting for God to save him and God says to him, what do you want, I sent you a boat and a helicopter? This is exactly the type of miracle that God did here.

Three days ago, late in the evening, Ian was getting ready to go to sleep. His left hand was hurting, sending out shooting pains. His eyes were closed. I got out of bed, held out my hand above his bandaged one, and prayed. I asked God to calm the pain and help the blood move as it should. I asked God to be with Ian. to give him peace. So you know, holding out my hand over a wound and praying is not something I normally do.

Ian opened his eyes and looked at me. What did you do he asked. The pain stopped. My hand feels better. I told him that I did not do anything but pray, and God did the rest.

For me, I need to stop looking for the God of the supernova, although He is definitely there as well. I need to look more for the God that can remove pain, can guide a surgeon's hand, who can change a family's life by bringing good from a bad situation.

Please keep praying.

Thank you for doing so.

Thank you Lord.

Ian is fourth on the surgery list today which means that he will be in surgery about ten o'clock.

More importantly, two more children arrived last night and need your prayers as well.

Getting my butt kicked at Uno

Please forgive the fact that this journal entry is a bit late. I was just about done when I hit a wrong button on the computer and lost everything that I had previously written. So, now I am doing it again for the second time, although this time it will be a bit more succint.

I was having a coke this afternoon with my wife Nanci and my work wife John. (Isn't it ironic that I am now caffienated while Ian is decaffienated?) We were discussing how well Shriners Hospital runs, and how they care for all of their patient, not just the physical needs. You have likely read my ramblings about how impressive Shriners is as a medical facilty for children with burns. While the nurses are fabulous and the doctors are top notch, so is the rest of the staff which I have not commented on (I think) before.

Shriners has an onsite school so that the kids who are here can keep up with their studies so when they return to class they are not as far behind.

Shriners has teams of counselors, to assist the burn victim themselves, as well as to work with their family, their friends, with their school, and nearly anyone else that the patient will come into contact with when they return from the hospital.

There is a snack cart that comes around each evening to the kids room that is staffed by volunteers. And, the cafe will pretty much make anything that the child wants at any time during their hours. So, if a kid wants pancakes at 4 in the afternoon, no problem.

We have not yet had much in the way of dealings with the OT/PT (occupational and physical therapists), but they have introduced themselves and let us know that they are here if we have any questions.

The housekeeping and cleaning staff always have a kind word, or a joke, or a smile for a catatonic parent.

I could go on and on and over time I am sure that I will, but the point is that these people care. And you cannot fake that.

Tonight, about six, I received an invite to the parent/caregiver game night that was to begin at 6:30 pm. Since Ian had a friend from school that he was just hanging out with watching a show, I thought I would give it a try. (By the way, thanks Adam!) I went down to the room, grabbed a diet pepsi and said hello to two of the women I knew. They are a mother and a daughter who are here from Kansas City. Their son will be here for several more months as he recovers.

Anyway, there were a total of seven women and me. We decided to play Uno, and I thought to myself, this should be fun since it is something that the Danihers play quite a bit on vacation. We even call it "have some" after what we started saying when someone gets a draw two or a wild draw four. It turns out that I was badly outclassed and got my \*head\* handed to me, losing every game and badly.

The real fun was getting to laugh with some other people who all have had little to laugh about recently. I was the only one from Ohio. One was from Michigan, another was from Tennessee, another was Vietnamese, and I forget where the others were from. Some have children/grandchildren who are back for their umpteenth surgery. Others, like myself, were newbies. Being local, I began to wonder what could be done to bring a bit of our city to these guests to make them feel welcome.

I bet that so many of these out of town visitors don't see any of our city except the airport, or the highway as they drive here for treatment, and the hospital itself. A common comment tonight was how nobody knew what day it was, or barely what time it was. I was thinking what can we do to make their stay more comfortable, and leave them with an even better feeling about Cincinnati? (And for those of you out of town, perhaps there is something special that you know about your area that you can offer to a hospital that treats children (and their parents) as they struggle with a health challenge.) Just a thought that may very well be worth revisiting.

Thanks for listening. 

Ian has surgery in the morning and I will post an update as soon as I learn how things go. They will be cleaning his left hand and determining how much of his middle finger and thumb are able to be saved. Until tomorrow.

Where is Joe Friday when you need him?

Just the facts, m'am. Ok, here goes.

Ian had the bandage changed on his hand this morning. Dr. Yakuboff, Chief of plastic surgery, visited Ian during this and observed his hand. Here is a link to his info on the Shriners' web page: 

Ian is scheduled to have surgery tomorrow. During the surgery, Dr. Kevin Bailey  and Dr. Yakuboff will see how much of Ian's thumb can be saved. It is nearly certain that he will lose the top of his thumb until the first joint, depending on how much, if any, of the bone is alive. They will not know more until they are able to examine parts of his hand in the operating room.

For some good news, the muscle and tissue part of this thumb at the base that is responsible for bringing the thumb over towards the fingers which is needed for grasping is in *good* shape and this is very encouraging. Ian's right hand is also healing very well and he has nearly complete movement of all of the fingers which is also positive news. His face is nearly healed with the exception of some spots and his chest is healing, although some of the wounds may be full thickness burns and require minor grafting.

Ian will have his fourth surgery on Friday. During the Thursday surgery, the doctors will discover how much healthy tissue is left. On Friday, they plan to create a groin flap and sew Ian's thumb into this flap to allow healthy tissue and blood vessels to attach themselves to the remaining thumb bone. His hand will be connected here for about two to three weeks.

Next steps? Well, we don't know for sure yet, but the highest probabililty at this point in time is to take part of a toe to rebuild the thumb. Ian asked me to ask about bionics, and Dr. Yakuboff indicated that the sense of touch has not yet been perfected in this area and is the single most significant need in a good working thumb.

Repeating a bit from some of my earlier postings, with electrical burns, the damage can take some time to manifest itself. That is why any reconstructive surgery has been delayed until now as reparing tissue which continues to die does not benefit anyone. Ian is also lucky that the electricity did not arc to his wrist or further down the arm. Had this happened, there would have been a significant risk of him losing his entire hand instead of part of a finger and part of his thumb.

Visitors are welcome today. Ian is in a pretty good frame of mind considering and he is actually hungry. He just wheeled behind me a few minutes ago on his way up to the cafeteria to toast his poptart; cold just did not suit his fancy. Gotta love Ian!

Can't sleep anymore this morning. Too many thoughts running through my head. It is making closing my eyes difficult. I feel sort of like I am riding a rollercoaster while talking on the phone, watching a movie and trying to eat all at the same time. Oh yeah, and taking a final exam that I did not know about so of course I did not study for in advance. I am not sure that I even signed up for this class. At least I have my clothes on...

Right now I guess I am getting a glimpse of what it must be like for those parents that have a child with a serious chronic illness. While I know that Ian will get better over time, my heart hurts for my previous callousness when I was too busy going through my own life to stop for ten minutes and to write a note or send an email or say a prayer for someone that, had I only picked up my eyes, I would have seen needed my help. But I was too busy worrying about me, and mine, to think about what I could have done to help others.

Most of us have so much. It is easy to look around at those with less and think that the reason that they don't have what we have is that they are not working hard enough, or that they did not make the "right" choices. I never thought that sometimes choices are made for them, and that it can happen at any time, whether or not you are prepared for it. Talk about on the job training!

I am sure that sometime in the hopefully not too distant future that Nanci's and my life will be back to "normal", whatever normal is with three teenagers. But I hope and pray that I don't return to the way that I was and that my compassion increases and that I remain aware of my obligation as a child of God to reach out to those who need assistance, rather than passing them by as I journey quickly from one place to the next.

Waiting...

(warning...not for the those with weak stomachs)

Tomorrow is the day that the hand surgeon will get a look at Ian's left hand and discuss with us the options that he sees. As of right now, things were tilting towards the option that Ian's left thumb would need to be amputated. It appeared that the blood vessels had been too badly damaged to get the needed nutrients to the still living tissue on the back of his thumb. IF there is enough living tissue, the plan was to create a flap of skin from Ian's thigh where it is full of muscle and plenty of blood vessels. Then, by sewing his left thumb into this flap, over about a two week period of time, the muscle and blood vessels would attach to his thumb bone and in effect create new tissue which could be used to rebuild his thumb. After this occured, the flap would be cut and Ian's hand would be free. This procedure has had terrific results in the past, but needs living bone to be able to have the new tissue attach itself to.

We have not spoken too much about the options. Ian does want to be given nitrous oxide tomorrow so that he won't feel the pain when they remove the wet bandage from his hand. His preference is to have the thumb flap procedure, if at all possible. We will simply have to wait and see how much damage the electricity did. I know that Ian has not given up hope.

Ian and I are planning on eating dinner in the fifth floor cafeteria instead of in his room. I think that it will be good for him to get out. His laptop has been approved for usage; his right hand simply gets tired pretty quickly.

I will write tomorrow's journal entry once I have a better idea of what the surgeon thinks Ian's options are, and when his surgery is likely to be.

Hi all... Another of my(ian's) short updates. Decent food and spotty wifi/TV reception r keeping me entertained. Chicken pot pie for lunch, (hopefully) some sort of fried rice for dinner, and all sorts of cereal for breakfast. (yay, sntnc fragmnt) Anyway, hand is hurting now, TY for your prayers and support.  

 Miss you all,

Small notes...

Nanci will spell me this morning at the hospital so that I can go home, get a shower, and see a client for a lunch meeting. I look forward to returning to a few of life's normal routines.

Boys can show their gratitude and love to a parent, without being a sissy, girly or any of the other adjectives that are used to keep them from doing so. Just because they can be gentle does not mean that they are not incredibly tough as well.

A smile can go a long way to brighten the day of the receiver. It does not hurt the giver either!

The value of a job does not necessarily equate to the job's monetary compensation. 

One thing it takes to do a job very, very well is passion. Passion cannot be faked.

Enjoy your day!

Gratitude, for what is and what it isn't...

In tough times, it is easy to get caught up in "why did this happen to me" and so forth. Honestly, so far, the thought has not crossed my mind. I do admit to wondering for a few seconds what I could have done to prevent what happened, and an analogy came to my mind. If Ian was a skateboarding fiend, grinding whenever he could, I would just have to accept the fact that along the way there would likely some cuts, bruises and perhaps even some broken bones. It would be my prayer that my son would take the precautions and protections that he could, and that he would have good judgment before undertaking a new stunt.

I know that the analogy is not precise, but, for those of you who know Ian, he has a pretty peculiar streak of taking things apart and seeing how things work. His mind wonders what if, and hmm, maybe I could improve this or that. It is perfectly logical to him that if he just used this particular tool, he would have finished his project and then he could go to bed. Famous words, but it seemed like a good idea at the time. It just did not work out the way that he expected.

For those friends of the family who have seen Ian in action, and have warned him about the dangers, I want you to know that Ian took ALL of your comments to heart and did listen to you. He really did. He was doing the very best that he could in trying to blend his desire to learn and experiment with his desire to push the envelope, just a bit, just because he could.

For all of you young adults out there reading this, let me jump on my soap box for just one minute. When your parents "suggest" that you do or do not do something, even though you disagree with them, or think that they might be out of touch, listen to the love behind their words. Most of us are only trying to do our best for you, the best way we know how.

Commercial message over...

Ian is doing better today; he checked out the school that they have here to help him stay up with his classwork while he is here, and then humored me and went to the afternoon program where the Cincinnati Zoo animal ambassadors brought in some creatures. Today they brought in an alligator named Largo, (about three feet long and about four years old), a cattle egret (the white bird that seems to be attached to each cow that you see in Florida) and a japanese rooster on a leash. I have seen a lot of things, but never a rooster that would let you touch it's tail.

After this, three Astronauts from NASA stopped by. They will be entering into the lab that is off the keys in Florida sometime during the next few weeks to work on what it feels like to build a space station in a weightless environment. The flight surgeon explained that his job will be to see how the human body performs difficult jobs when it is sleep deprived. At this comment, both Ian and I could not stifle our laughter. Not very well Ian whispered to me...

We explained to the flight surgeon a bit later how we did not mean to be rude, but this was a significant factor to Ian being here at Shriners. Ian was able to get his picture taken with the three gentlemen, and I will try to get it, and a copy of Ian with the clowns on to this blog in the next few days.

Pleasant dreams to all who are reading this on Monday evening. I want to continue to express me and my family's gratitude for all of those who send their wishes and prayers. It means so very much to us.

The one favor that I ask is that you be willing to expand your prayer list to include the other kids here at Shriners. Many of them are here completely without having anything to do with it, and are in much more physical jeapordy than Ian is. Each one of them can use your prayers for their healing and well being and peace.

And finally, I want to express my admiration for those people who work here. It truly takes a person with a big heart and a gift for working in a stressful situation. Hug the next nurse you see.

A good night's sleep

Ian is still sleeping, which is good. Today will mostly be "hanging out" as they won't be changing his bandages again until tomorrow or Wednesday. The goal for today is to continue to get him to eat and to get up and moving around. Ian is also likely to get his laptop today which will help him to use his right hand. 

The zoo visits the hospital today which Ian is looking forward to.

Rumors and misinformation...

A couple of Ian's friends from school stopped by to cheer him up today. I was fascinated with a few of the stories that they shared about the "information" that went around school the first two days about Ian's injuries.

* He was struck by lightening. Close, but not entirely accurate. It does appear that either the surge protector for the plasma cutter was on when it should have been off, or it arched and made contact with the wrong material, specifically him instead of his poetry book cover.
* Ian was burned by a homemade flamethrower made out of microwave parts. Again, partially true. Ian has not yet made a flamethrower. Even though his father (me) has always had pyro tendencies, since it takes one to know one, I have done my best to limit any creations that make open flames. The transformer for the plasma cutter was made from an old microwave transformer.
* Ian was shot. Hmm. No guns here, just electricity. In many ways, it could have been less painful to have been shot, depending on *where *he was shot. He has had several SHOTS of morphine since the injury, and he was shocked, but no guns were involved.

Earlier this afternoon, Ian gave me a bit of a lesson on electricity. I thought I would pass it along so that you may have a better understanding of what exactly was he doing and what might have happened. For all you science gurus out there, I have put what Ian told me in my own words so if I am wrong in my description, it is because of my errors in trying to explain it.

Basically, there are two main components of electricity that you will hear about, Voltage and Amperage. Think of voltage as the willingness of electricity to "jump" from one item to the next. A static electricity shock may have high voltage when the spark "jumps" from your finger, but it does very little damage because it does not pack much energy. If you see the sparks flying from a Tesla coil in an old science movie, the spark bridging the gap between the two places may make a lot of noise and look impressive, but it is not tremendously dangerous.

Amperage, ian explained, is the "width" of the electrical power. Imagine a small copper wire, a toothpick, a pencil, and a copper water pipe. Each one of these would represent greater amperage. The wider the "flow" the more power. I believe that most of the circuit breakers in your home are designed to trip at 15 to 20 amps.

Ian rewired the transformer to increase the voltage while decreasing the amperage. I will ask him for the precise amounts, but the voltage was more than household current while the amperage was much less. Still, it was enough to cause the damage that it did when it came into contact with him and not the items he was trying to weld.

What likely saved Ian's life was the fact that he did try to take safety precautions. While one can argue that the safest thing to do would be NOT to attempt to weld, in your bedroom, at 12:30 at night, without your parents knowing about it, after being overly tired and ingesting too much caffiene, but to Ian it seemed logical that a short bit of work would finish his project and let him get to bed.

Ian had the plasma cutter connected to a surge protector. He had the solid non flamable surface to work on, his project was neatly laid out and ready to go, and he had flame extinguishers on hand in case things smoldered too much. Here is where things went wrong and we will likely never know exactly what happened, but it appears that the plasma cutter was active when he went to move it to the solid surface. Likely he may have made contact with both of the leads when it was hot, or some of the insulation may have had a crack or, but whatever the reason, his hand took the brunt of the juice. When Nanci first found him, he was on his back holding his hands which means that the surge protector must have tripped shutting off the tool. Had it not, well, I can only guess that Ian would now be only a memory and I prefer not to think of this possibility.

Thanks again for your prayers, your offers of support and so forth. It means so very much to Nanci and I, and also to Ian. He wanted me to make sure that I put that comment in tonight's message.

Until next time,

jeff

A lazy Sunday afternoon update...

One quick clarification; Ian has not yet had his laptop approved, but we are working on it. He posted his morning "hello" while on his daily stroll around the ward. They have rigged up an IV wheeled pole to allow him to rest the slug and shuffle around floor. Ian's dad gets the fun job of being the mule cart driver.

Yesterday, Ian was wondering how nice it would be to have "the force". He thought that if he would only need to hold out his hand, the object could come to him. I looked at him and said force/shmorse. You have me! all you have to do is to hold out your hand, point, and I get it for you! I told him not to get used to it...

One more quick "ianism". This morning, before they changed his dressing, he asked for a piece of paper. He then proceeded to sketch a quick plan for ways to improve the safety of his plasma cutter. Ian may have been thrown by the horse, but he certianly has no fear of getting back on. Go Ian!

Bye for now.

I have been sitting here in front of the computer for about ten minutes and don't quite know how to start this update with anything witty or funny.

Ian had his bandage on his left hand changed this morning. Ian described it with just one word. Pain.

In a way, this is good news. While he would certainly not think that there is anything good about pain right now, it does indicate that a good part of his hand still has feeling and is recovering.

While it is still too early to tell for sure, the color in his thumb is *not* what the doctor was hoping for. I guess that with electrical burns, there can be damage to cells that are not originally visible and that only show up as time goes on. We will know a bit more when the hand specialist visits with him on Tuesday or Wednesday, but the thumb-o-meter is currently tilting in the wrong direction.

EDITORIAL COMMENT: Writing this blog is a bit of a selfish thing for me to do so please forgive me if I don't communicate the information that you are looking for in the way that you are looking for it. As Ian's dad, I am likely to magnify certain things in a much more personalized way and insulate myself from other, more painful realities. 

Right now, what I know, is that Ian will still be with us. He is likely to be in the hospital for a good while yet. He is getting the best care possible; there is nothing different or better that we could be doing. Our family has received an unimaginable outpouring of love and support. Ian will be coming home, and will be "Ian" even if he is minus a couple of digits and/or a thumb. There are families that I talk with every day here at Shriners whose child is in much more dire straights than Ian. These kids need your prayers as well.

Do me a favor. Make sure that you tell somebody who you have not said it to recently that you love them, just the way that they are.

Later,

jeff

Clown Fear

Today was the special joint visit of the Dayton and Cincinnati clowns here at Shriners. Ian was hesitant to go, but I encouraged him since many of these individuals are responsible for raising the funds that continues to endow the hospitals.

Ian was treated to his father wearing a rubber chicken beaking and clucking along to old MacDonald has a farm. More than anything else, Ian was able to recognize that while his burns are serious, his injury pales in comparison to all of the other children here. While it is difficult to say "we are fortunate his injuries were not worse", it is clear that the damage could have been much, much worse.

On the bright side, Dr. Kagan, while making rounds, gave Ian a verbal kick in the rear to motivate him to get out of bed and take a stroll. The deal was that if he ate, he could lose the IV and that was enough for Ian. He made a couple of laps around the ward and was able to work up some hunger. All good. And he did not complain, too much, about having to sit in the front row and watch the corny, and well intended, antics of the clowns.

Ian continues to suffer through computer withdrawal, and he will have to wait until Monday to get his laptop "approved" for usage. Every outside piece of electric equipment is tested to make sure that it is properly grounded and does not draw too much current. Somehow, I doubt that Ian's Plasma Cutter would be approved for usage here. 

On Sunday morning, Ian will get his first dose of Nitrous when they change the dressings on his left hand. He should be done by noon, so visitors after that time are welcome.

My goal is to get some photos up here by tomorrow evening, including proof that Ian has beaten his clown fear. His room is now becoming decorated with well wishes from his friends, including his layout and design class from CHCA. The color sure brightens things up. Ian wanted me to pass along a big thank you to everyone.

Good Morning!

Ian, and Dad, slept well last night. 

Dr. Kagan just lead rounds and gave Ian a couple of instructions. First, eat and you can get your IV out. (No problem with Ian wanting this to happen). Second, get out of bed! (Also no problem with this happening either.)

What is really cool about Shriners is that rather than a meal just showing up, Ian can order what he wants to eat from a two page menu, whenever he wants to eat. For breakfast this morning he is going to try their chocolate chip pancakes with a side of crisp bacon. As to his beloved tea, he is currently limited to two cups a day, even if it is decaf, because they want him to have calories, calories, calories.

Besides Ian, Mom and Dad, how is the rest of the family doing? Let's start with Sean. He had the most difficult time originally because he saw Ian's hands early Thursday morning right after the accident. Sean had some trouble sleeping the first night but once he was able to see Ian in the hospital and know that his brother will be OK and that he is in the best place for his care, Sean felt much better. Sean visited Ian yesterday afternoon and sat patiently by him while he slept for all but the last five minutes Sean was there. Sean made sure that Ian's tea bags were brought from home and has been busy taking care of the cats, Pete and Piggly. On Monday of last week, Sean had his interview at Cincinnati Hills Christian Academy, and looks forward to joining his brother next year at the school as a sixth grader. This weekend is Sean's championship swim meet at our local YMCA.

Megan has been a real source of strength for Mom and Dad. She and Sean have made sure that Ian's room has pictures of his furry friends. My favorite was one that she took of our orange and white cat we call Chuck. Each morning Chuck usually "noses" his people. Often the first thing you will see when you open your eyes is Chuck's furry face in yours. Well, Megan got a close up picture of Chuck's furry face and she taped it on Ian's bed right next to his head.

Megan's championship swimmeet is next weekend in Oxford Ohio. Grandma and Grandpa Daniher will be in town to help out, so Megan is still planning on attending this meet. And, although she has times that qualify her for competing at the Zone level, she has decided NOT to attend this meet which would have been the following weekend in Columbus Ohio. The YMCA zone meet includes the best swimmers from Michigan, Ohio, Indiana and some other states.

On yesterday morning (Friday), Megan had her interview and shadow day at Saint Ursula Academy, which is an elite all girls school here in town. She was given her letter of acceptance upon finishing her day, and now she has a tough decision of whether she wants to go to CHCA with her siblings or to SUA with her friends from swim team. I think that she is leaning towards SUA and her friends at this point. She is really excited about the tablet PC that she will have at that school and can't wait to tell Ian about it. She also visited Ian last night although he does not know it since he was ZZZZing at the time.

Pete, the *wonderdog*, misses Ian terribly. Ditto for Ian to Pete. He has already asked if Pete can visit him here.

Well, I am going to check on Ian to see if his breakfast has arrived. I am hopeful that later today I may be able to get some photos uploaded to this site so that you can see where Ian is as well as read about it.

8:00 PM and the announcement just came over the loudspeaker that visiting hours are over...

ZZZZZ. Ian has spent most of the day sleeping. Besides the prayers and well wishers, the highlight of his day was getting off his heart monitors. His docs were concerned due to the fact that when Ian visited the ER at Mercy Anderson, they checked his heart rate. When someone gets a big electric jolt, their heart can do funny things. In Ian's case, however, it turns out it was something else, NOT the electricity.

It was...

CAFFEINE!

Ian's favorite drink is BAWLS, which comes in a blue bottle. It is a favorite drink of computer geeks everywhere and packs an extra wallop of caffeine. Drink one of those, a few cups of tea, some Dr. Pepper, and presto, instant irregular heart beat. Ian has been warned by his surgeon to be careful, or his doctor may BAN him from caffeine. That would almost be as bad as banning him from the internet.

Speaking of which, Ian is anxious to get his PC back, even if he has to type one handed. He won't have a net connection in his room because of the electronics everywhere (think airplane #######) but within a week or two, we can likely figure out some way for him to get connected back to the wired world.

The next few days are likely to be pretty boring for visitors unless you like to watch Ian sleep. He is still pretty heavily medicated. If you think that you might want to visit Ian this weekend, how about Sunday after lunch? If this does not fit in your schedule, please come if and when you are able, but also please consider this. Ian will be here for a while. I am sure that he will get bored pretty quickly and most likely will welcome visitors more readily in a few days. As Mike Meyers says "*Thank you very much; I'm here till Thursday. Try the veal*" Well, Ian will be here at least thru Thursday, a couple of weeks from now, and they don't serve veal here, but other than that...

Thank you everyone for the prayers. Ian's thumb is not out of the woods yet as the electricity did a number on it. The surgeon and hand specialist hope that the blood flow continues so, if you would ask God for Ian's body to continue sending oxygen carring red blood to his thumb, and then away again (still a problem) back to his heart, I would personally appreciate it. As any parent knows, I would trade places with Ian in a second.

Ian's spirits are still up, when he is awake. Have a cup of decaf tea and toast Ian. He'll appreciate it!

Fresh off the press...

I just finished meeting with Ian's surgeon. First, the team was pleasantly surprised that Ian has more living tissue on the back of his thumb than they expected. The end of his thumb is still darker than they would like which could mean that there are drainage issues due to damaged veins.

Ian did burn his lower thumb joint all the way to the bone. He does not have much tissue left near his thumb joint He has also severed many of the nerves to his thumb which could restrict its function later in his life. 

The surgeons added cadaver tissue to cover his wound for short term protection. This will not be a long term solution but is being done for infection reasons. Ian will continue to have "the slug" on the end of his left hand until his next surgery later next week. The doctors will change his dressing several times this coming week, the first one to be on Sunday.

Ian and I named his wet dressing "the slug". It is a brown gauze wrap that covers the entire left hand to below his wrist. There are two red "eye stalks" that are used to allow for introduction of saline and anti bacterial fluids to keep his wound wet and clean. Ian is not a big fan of the slug, mostly because it is wet and uncomfortable.

In the short term, Ian will most likely be out of school for at least the month of March. This does not mean that he won't have homework; just that he may not be able to attend regular classes. Great that Ian has had homeschool experience; now he can have hospital school experience.

Later next week, one possible procedure to help Ian's thumb recover is something called a groin flap. While I don't understand all of the details, basically Ian's left thumb would be sewn into a flap of skin in his left thigh so that the muscles from his thigh will actually grow to replace the missing muscle in his thumb. Once the tissue has bonded to his thumb, then they can work on grafting some healthy skin onto the top of the new healthy muscle.

Well, I am going to check on Ian in recovery. More info will follow later today as I hear more.

And yes, I did get some sleep last night. Thanks to my practice sleeping with ear plugs on some business trips, I was able to block out most of the background noise while still hearing Ian's monitors when they went off a few times.

Good Morning Everyone!

Ian slept well and just awoke to get cleaned up and ready for the day. His sense of humor is definitely here as is his curiousity.

Ian just asked if he would be allowed to have his dog Pete visit him...

Last night we got some pictures put up of some of his favorite things: A cup of herbal decaf tea, his cats, his brother and sister, some of his friends. My favorite one is a close up picture of Chuck the cat's face which is taped right next to the top of his bed...just like Chuck visits him every morning.

Ian is scheduled for surgery at 7 and I will do my best to post an update as soon as I hear from the doctor.

Just before 5 pm.

Ian has been catching up on his sleep. His pain continues to be managed by the morphine. The staff here is top notch and exceeds the service of ANY hotel I have ever stayed in...too bad you have to be injured to be here. 

There are 17 kids currently in the burn ward, two of which are local. The Shriners will fly kids in from across the country and even from outside the US.

While Ian's burns are severe, he is lucky that they are confined to a pretty small area. He will be first on the schedule for surgery tomorrow AM at about 7.

We have taken a couple of polaroids and tomorrow I will bring my camera to update this website with a few pics.

3:30 pm update

Ian is now awake and talkative. His pain has gone down a bit, but he still is taking care to make sure that he keeps up with the medicine he needs.

Ian's dry sense of humor is doing quite well. His desire for pieces parts is also thriving and so far he has asked to keep all of the electrical sticky connectors for his pulse and heart rate. He has been grilling his nurse about whether the diode in the pulse unit is an led or not. Hmm. Just like Ian.

Nanci, Sean and Megan plan on visiting this evening.

12:30 pm on March 1

Ian has now celebrated one half day since his accident. He recently awoke from surgery and is still a bit groggy. His first request was for a bottle of Bawls to address his caffine addiction. The nurse said no, you will have to deal with ice chips.

The electric shock did the most damage to his left hand. At this time, we do not know the extent of the damage; only the next few days will let us know how much of the tissue in his thumb and fingers will make it. What looks bad today maybe better tomorrow and what looks good today may not be healthy tomorrow. Electric burns can damage tissue that cannot be seen from the surface.

Shriner's Burn Hospital in Cincinnati is one of three such facilities in the United States. Ian's care has been exceptional. Since everything here is supported by charitable donations, and since flowers are NOT allowed in the burn unit, if you want to send a card, please do! If you want to send a gift, please send it to Shriner's for the Ian tech fund...he has already found several things that he would like to "fix" here at the hospital such as PC access and so forth...

Ian's first words after waking up were "when is my surgery?" When I explained that he had it five hours ago, he commented that he would have surgery like this any time.

This is a good thing as Ian likely has several procedures ahead of him. Today's was exploratory, and designed to remove burned tissue. Tomorrow they will see how his left hand is doing and what they may be able to do to repair the damage.

I must apologize for the directness of this blog. I find that the truth is the best way to convey difficult information. I will try to keep it so that everyone can read it without getting grossed out, but there is not a simple way to describe what happened to him.

Accidents do happen. I am thankful that there were no policeman to stop me on my 90 mile an hour drive to the hospital, that the folks at Mercy Anderson recognized almost instantly that Ian needed advanced care, that the ambulance drivers took care to avoid every bump that they could (an ambulance is simply a fancy U-haul), that it was not raining when we needed to get Ian to Shriners, that there are exceptional specialists here to give him treatment, and, most importantly, that the electricity did not do more damage than it did. It is not beyond the realm of probability that Ian could have died from the electric shock that he received.

I will do my best to update this as often as I can. Please send Ian cards care of our home address or care of the hospital address listed. Pictures are great as well.

As soon as I know more about how long he will be here, and what we should expect, I will let you know.

And, most importantly, please keep praying for Ian. I can feel your support and it has been keeping me going when all I want to do is cry.

love, jeff
