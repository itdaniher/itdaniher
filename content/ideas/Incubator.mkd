The below information pertains to the design and construction of a single-petri dish closed-loop incubator. 
The primary heating elements will be constructed from traces on a printed circuit board(PCB). 
These PCBs will sandwich the Petri dish on top and bottom, providing close contact with both heating elements as well as sensors. 
The system will utilize an external control board based on an Atmel microcontroller offering stand-alone operation, as well as programmatic operation through a serial interface. 
The system will be placed in a close-fitting insulated box, reducing energy needs and increasing thermal stability.
