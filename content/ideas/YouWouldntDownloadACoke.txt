Coke Freestyle


I got a chance to muck around with a Coke Freestyle machine in the past - as I mentioned, it's just a glorified bunch of printer cartridges and a CO2 tank. It was designed by Dean Kamen, the segway inventor.


Anyway, here's a picture: http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5172/5495563122_b904279a9a_b.jpg


It's a bunch of proprietary base syrups - coke base, sprite base, etc - and proprietary flavoring mixes - cherry, lime, lemon, etc.


It's worth noting that the diet syrups - diet coke - are all small as the artificial sweeteners are considerably more powerful than sugar. The flavorings are the same size as the diet sodas.
It’s all Chemicals
Here’s the direction I’d take this. It’s all chemicals. How much of an overlap is there between Dr. Pepper’s 23 flavors and 7Up’s 7 flavors? We’ll never know, as all that stuff is super-trade-secret. 


How many different types of sodas do you think you could make out of Dr. Pepper’s 23 flavors? Probably quite a few.


Instead of having macroscale cartridges for each brand, break everything down into component flavoring compounds. Use technology borrowed from insulin pumps or printer cartridges or microfluidics to facilitate precise microdosing of different flavoring compounds. Recombine colors and flavors, giving you a tremendous variety of possible sodas from the same handful of chemicals.
Don’t [not?] be Evil


1. go online and download a new soda
2. vote on your favorite variety of soda
3. “flavor of the month” club
4. printer cartridge pricing - give away the dispensers, charge $$ for the flavor cartridges
5. tweak the ratio of flavoring components of your favorite soda, personalizing it a’la the long tail - http://www.longtail.com/about.html
6. killer market access - run trials remotely, pay and/or get paid for people to participate in flavor research
7. build “an app store for sodas” 


Goals
1. “app store for sodas”
2. provide a tech backbone for longtail soda based on the premise “lots of people will pay extra for something customized to their tastes” 
3. make money
4. piss off Coke/Pepsi megacompanies
