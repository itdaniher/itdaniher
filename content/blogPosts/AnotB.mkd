The point is....

* "Desktop" more than "Manufacturing"
* "Physical" more than "Computing"
* "Personal" more than "Computing"

It's not about the technology as much as it's about making that technology - the engines of creation and tools of mechanization - accessible to the people who will best use it to meet needs.
